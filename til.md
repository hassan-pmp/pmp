	- How can we create repeatable steps for data engineering?
	
	- How can we continuously monitor and evaluate data quality?
	
	- How can we effectively use or modify thirdparty data?
	
	- When and How should humans be involved in data lableing?
	
	- What additional steps can we take to augment data?

- Data Labeling:
	- Supervised learning needs labled data
 	- how to get it:
	  	- Label it yourself
	  	- Find existing labeled datasets
	  	- Have users label it
	  	- Hire contractors
	  	- Use data labeling services    


- How much your data be transformed to meet project requirments?
- What's your approach to data cleansing, merging, and labeling?
- Have you identified and removed or mitigated biased or incomplete data?
- Are your data piplines clearly laid out with sources, transformations, and destinations?
- Do you have the right mix of skills and technologies to implement this pipline effectively?


**CPMAI Phase IV: Model Development**:

	- How can we transform the data into a machine learning model that meets the project's requirements?
 
	- How effectively are we training the machine learning model?
 
	- How successfully are we optimizing the model?

	- Data drift
	- Data provenance
	- Model discovery
- **ML Dev**:

	- Model Monitoring
- DevOps introduced the idea of continuous monitoring and versioning, keeping track of which model version is in use, how well it's performing, and whwther you need to roll back to a previous model if problem arise. 
- **Data Drift**: which is the problem that the data feeding your model changes over time, which can cause AI systems to perform poorly over time.
- **Model Drift**: in which the model's predictions becomes less reliable as real world conditions shift, which can also cause AI system to degrade in performance.
- **Data Provenance**: which is undestanding exactely which data went into training each version of your model.
- **Model Governance**: what rules do we need to follow on how to version and update models? Who decides when to update it? and how do you ensure compliance with regulations or organiyational policies?

- Iterate modls to keep them accurate in the teal world
- Stable environments may require less frequent updates
- Dynamic environments need regular model evaluation and updates.
- Successful AI depends on predictable and continuous improvment cycles
  
![Capture1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7a4b9d2-e489-4721-ad2c-0ed019ab5cf5)

- How will the model's impact on business goals be measured?
- How will success be defined, and when will improvements be needed?

# 06.04.2025 Feedback Frameworks: Feedback: Lesson_1
- **SBI Model**: Highly actionable and straightforward. Good for performance improvment. It’s a **simple**, **quick**, and **effective** framework for giving clear and respectful feedback — especially helpful when time is tight or emotional sensitivity is high. It’s often used in leadership, peer feedback, and coaching environments.


	- **S:Situation** - Explain the situation - In what context did it happen?
		- “…when we were discussing the QA team’s report on the latest release…”
			- Anchors the feedback in a real moment
			- Keeps it **objective** and **grounded**
	- **B: Behaviour** - describe the Behaviour
 		- Ex: You raised your voice in the team meeting…
			- Focus on observable actions
			- Avoid judgment or vague labels
	- **I:Impact**- Share the Impact
 		- Ex: “…which made the team hesitant to contribute and escalated the tension in the room.”
			- Emphasizes consequences
			- Promotes self-awareness and responsibility
- **Why Use the BSI Model?**
- ✅ Super straightforward and fast
- ✅ Ideal for everyday feedback
- ✅ Helps teams create a feedback culture
- ✅ Minimizes blame and emotional defensiveness

- **COIN Model**: Emphasises relationship-building alongside feedback. the **COIN Model** is a simple yet powerful framework for giving **constructive**, **actionable feedback** in a structured and emotionally intelligent way.

	- **C: Context**: Describe the situation clearly and objectively. Set the scene. 
		- Ex: In yesterday’s project review meeting...
	- **O: Observation**: Share what you specifically saw or heard — avoid interpretations or judgments.
		- Ex: "...you interrupted the QA lead twice while she was presenting the testing status."
	- **I – Impact**: Describe the effect of the behavior — on the project, team, or individual.
		- Ex: "...which made it harder for her to fully explain the risks, and the team seemed hesitant to speak up after that."
	- **N – Next Steps or Way Forward**: End with a suggestion, question, or commitment for improvement.
		- Ex: "Let’s work on creating more space for each person to speak during our reviews. Would you be open to trying that next time?"
-** Why Use the COIN Model?**
- ✅ Encourages non-defensive conversations
- ✅ Builds psychological safety
- ✅ Promotes accountability and growth
- ✅ Helps managers and peers give feedback that’s specific and actionable, not vague or personal

- **Bonus: When to Use COIN**
- ✅ 1:1 performance feedback
- ✅ Peer feedback during retrospectives
- ✅ Real-time course correction
- ✅ Coaching conversations
- ✅ Leadership and development sessions

- The **GROW Model** is another must-have in your leadership and coaching toolkit — especially powerful for **goal-setting**, **problem-solving**, and **developmental coaching**.
- **G – Goal**: What do you want to achieve? This is the desired outcome — clear, measurable, and time-bound.
- “What’s the goal you want to achieve from this sprint/career review/project?”
- Example:
	- ✅ "I want to improve stakeholder communication and reduce escalations by 30% this quarter."

- **R – Reality**: What’s happening right now? Assess the current situation honestly.
- “What’s working? What’s not? What have you tried so far?”
- Example:
	- ✅ "We don’t have a regular update rhythm with the client. Most communication happens reactively when something breaks."

- **O – Options (or Obstacles)**:  What could you do? Generate possibilities. Brainstorm multiple paths forward.
- “What options do you have? What else? What’s within your control?”
- Example:
	- ✅ "I could propose a weekly sync with the client, or assign a stakeholder liaison on our team."

-** W – Way Forward / Will**: What will you do next? Turn insights into concrete actions with ownership and accountability.
- “What’s your next step? When will you do it? What support do you need?”
- Example:
	- ✅ "I’ll draft a stakeholder meeting cadence by Friday and review it with the Product Owner."

- Why the GROW Model Works So Well at Work
- ✅ Encourages self-reflection and ownership
- ✅ Moves from problem to action
- ✅ Builds coaching conversations into team culture
- ✅ Works beautifully in 1:1s, retros, OKR check-ins, career development

- the **CEDAR Model** is a structured, practical framework designed to guide **developmental conversations**, particularly around performance and feedback. It's widely used in leadership coaching, people development, and organizational performance reviews. It was created by **Jenny Rogers**, a leading executive coach, and is especially effective for turning feedback into growth.

- **C – Context**: Set the stage: Why are we having this conversation? “Let’s talk about your recent sprint review presentation — it’s a great opportunity to reflect and grow.”
- Clarifies the purpose
- Removes ambiguity
- Aligns both parties

- **E – Examples**: Use specific examples to highlight behavior or results. “You presented the sprint progress, but skipped over some key blockers that QA had flagged earlier in Slack.”
- Avoids generalizations
- Anchors the conversation in facts, not opinions

- **D – Diagnosis**: Collaboratively explore what’s going on beneath the surface.“What do you think happened there? What influenced your decision to skip that part?”
- Encourages self-reflection
- Builds shared understanding
- Surfaces hidden blockers (skill, mindset, systems) 

- **A – Actions**: Define what should be done next. What improvements or changes can be made? “Let’s try integrating a checklist for blockers in your next sprint review — would that help?”
- Moves from insight to action
- Encourages accountability
- Empowers the person to shape their path forward

- **R – Review**: Agree how and when you’ll check back in. “Let’s revisit this in our 1:1 next Friday — I’d love to hear how it went.”
- Reinforces follow-through
- Builds momentum and trust
- Turns feedback into a loop, not a one-off event

- **Why Use the CEDAR Model?**
- ✅ Focuses on learning, not just evaluation
- ✅ Supports psychological safety and growth
- ✅ Works in coaching, leadership, and HR contexts
- ✅ Bridges the gap between performance feedback and developmental support

- **When to Use It**:
- Performance check-ins
- Project debriefs
- Sprint reviews and Agile retrospectives
- Coaching or mentoring sessions
- Career development conversations

- **Summary**:

# 04.04.2025 Everyday AI Concepts: CPMAI: Lesson_1
- 80% of AI projects Fail?
- **Why?**
	- The ROI is not justified by the project
	- The time between pilot to full production is too long.
	- Data Quality Issues
	- Trusting the Vendors Too much (Product mismatch, Overhype, and Oversell)
	- Not enough data
	- Building a model before you know how it will be used in the real world
	- Lack of understanding of data
	- Overpromisiong and Underdelivering
- **Think Big**, **Start Small**, and **Iterate Often**, which is key to AI project success. 
- **Key to Successful AI projects**
	- Use proven, data-focused project management methods
	- Treat AI projects lig Big Data, not traditional software development
	- Go beyond Agile or the Scientific Method
	- Cultivate an intelligent, data-driven mindset
- Are we tackling the right problem?
- Is AI the right solution to the problem?
- What type or pattern od AI makes the most sense for the solution?
- **CPMAI Methodology**
  
![CPMAI_Methodology](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe80dfe6-164c-4a6c-ac6b-3c6bf7667d18)

- AI success depond on data
	- AI Projects
 		- Are fundamentally different from traditional software development
   		- Aren't about application development- it's about data
     		- Cannot be run like traditional app development
       		- Require a data-centric approach
- AI projects as Data management and Processing Projects
	- Use Data-Centric Methodoligies
 	- Use Data-Centric Technologies
  	- Build Data-Centric Talent
  	- Still need Business-Centric ROI
  	- Leverage Exiting Szstems and Agile Methodoloies
  	- Find ways to continuously update skills and methods
- Traditional Project Approaches Don't Work Well for AI
	- **Predictive** approaches are too rigid, slow, and risky
 	- **Challanges**: Hard to predict obstacles and adopt to changes.
  - **Agile** approaches need tweaks to allow continous learning and fast iteration.
  - **Benefits**: Faster value delivery, flixibility to re-prioritize.
  - **Key Challenge**: Balancing continuous model updates with deployment.
 
  - The real complexity lies in and how you shape and prepare the data. That's the secret sauce that gives your AI system its intelligence.
  - How we ensure reliable results. how to measure and evaluate results, and how we assess what the AI is actually doing.
  - If we say AI, we run rge risk of talking about projects with vastly different scope, risk, cost, data needs and technology challanges.
  - **Seven Patterns of AI** : tend to fall into seven main categories of ways in which people apply AI to meet their needs.
  	- **The Conversational Pattern**: Focuses on AI systems that can undestand and respond to human language in a natural interactive way. You might see this in chat bots & virtual assistants.
   	- **The Recognition pattern**: Deals with AI systems that identify & categories objects or signals from various data sources such as images, audio, or text. For example, facial recognition technology and handwriting or text extraction from documents both fall under this umbrella. Recognition applications reqire a lot of training, data, and robust validation to ensure they accurately handle real world variability while still performing reliably and efficiently. 
    	- **The Pattern and Anomaly Detection Pattern**: The pattern and anomally detection pattern focuses on finding meaningful regularrities or irregularrities in complex data sets. This includes spotting strange spikes in network traffic, detecting fraudulent transactions and financial data, or even identifying early warning signs of quipment failure in manufacturing.
     	- **The Predictive Analysis & Decision Pattern**: AI system shift through historical and real-time data to help people forecast outcomes. 
      	- **The Hyper-Personalization Pattern**: is to use to tailor suggestions to individual users such as recommending products on an e-commerce site or streaming content on a media olatform
      	- **The Autonomous System Pattern**: Focus on the AI systems that can operate with minimal human intervention.  
      	- **The Goal-Driven System pattern**: Focuses on AI that optimizes for specefic objective, like scheduling tasks across multiple teams, playing games, or rope planning for efficient logistics.
  - By identifying the correct pattern or patterns for your AI solution, you can pick the right data strategy, the right technology, and AI solutions to meet the requirements and the right success metrics for the AI project.
- **CPMAI Phase 1: Business Understanding**
	- what problem are we solving?
 		- That can AI realy help
   		- Which parts of the project actually need AI and which do not?
     		- How we will measure success, financial time savings, Compliance, user satisfaction,  or something else?
       		- What skills or resources do we need to successfully impliment the AI solution? 
	- Is AI/Cognitive technology the right solution?
	- Which parts are require AI?
	- What AI patterns will we use?
	- How will we measure success?
	- What are the project requirements?
	- What other considerations exist?
	- What skills are needed?
- ROI
  	- Financial (Saving or Generateing Money)
   	- Time saving
    	- Reducing the hourse a team needs to spend on repetitive tasks
	- Reducing the errors in a previously manual process
  	- Show up as resource saving such as lowering operational costs, or cutting down on manual processes. 
- The AI Go/No-Go Decision
	- use this chart to gauge the feasibilty of your AI project


| Business Feasibility | 
| --- |
| Is there a clear problem definition? |
| Is the organiyation willing to invest in change?|
| Is there sufficient ROI or impact? |

- Do we have a well defined problem?
- Do Stakeholders agree it's a priority?
- Will the organiyation acyually use the solution after it's built?
  

| Implementation Feasibility |
| --- |
| Does the data measure what you care about? |
| Is there enough data to train systems and is it accessible? |
| Is the data sufficient quality? |

- Do you have the technology and skills to develop and deploy this AI model?
- Can the AI solution operate where you plan to use it?

- **Instead of each question being a simple Yes or No answer, think of each question like a traffice light.**
- **Green = Go**
- **Yellow = Proceed with caution**
- **Red =  Stop**
- The goal of Go or No-Go is to answer all the key questions of feasibility with traffic light answers and ensure that you have as many greens as possible. 


|Data Feasibility|
| --- |
| Do you have the required technology and skills?|
| Can you execute the model in a timely manner? |
| Does it make sense to use the model where you plan to use it?|

- An AI project can only move forward if three feasibility factors align: **Business**, **Data**, **Technology**/**Execution**.

- The Proof of Concept (PoC) vs the Pilot
- PoC: Demonstrates a concepts in a test environment. Never gets deployed in the real world.
- Pilot: A real-world project that uses emerging teachnologies in a protected, safe environment but used in real-worls production. 
- **Ask yourself, what does success looks like?**
- **Which AI pattern do we need?**

**CPMAI Phase 2: Data Undestanding**
- What data we need to meet our objectives?
- How much data do we have, and is it of sufficient quality?
- What internal and external data are required?
- What additional data do we need to enhance our current dataset?
- What are the ongoing requirements for data gathering and prepration?
- What technology is needed for data manipulation and transformation?
- Are there any other important data-related factors we should consider?

- AI projects are really data projects. 
- Phase 1: Why do we need AI to solve this problem?
- Phase 2: What data is needed to support those AI business requirements?






# 31.03.2025 Everyday AI Concepts: Predictive AI: Lesson_1
- **Backpropagation of Errors (Backprop)**: When the network makes a bad guess, this failure goes back up through the network to make future changes.
- A key part of a neural network is that it's adjustable
- A data model is an abstraction that helps you understand a larger data set. 
# 31.03.2025 Microsoft Generative AI: Responsible Generative AI Process: Lesson_1
-  The four stages in the process
	-   Identify potential harms that are relevant to your planned solution.
 		- Identify potential harms
   		- Prioritize identified harms
     		- Test and verify the prioritized harms
       		- Document and share the verified harms   
	- Measure the presence of these harms in the outputs generated by your solution.
	- Mitigate the harms at multiple layers in your solution to minimize their presence and impact, and ensure transparent communication about potential risks to users.
	- Operate the solution responsibly by defining and following a deployment and operational readiness plan.
- Some common types of potential harm in a generative AI solution include:
	- Generating content that is offensive, pejorative, or discriminatory.
	- Generating content that contains factual inaccuracies.
	- Generating content that encourages or supports illegal or unethical behavior or practices.
- A generalized approach to measuring a system for potential harms consists of three steps:
	-  Prepare a diverse selection of input prompts that are likely to result in each potential harm that you have documented for the system. For example, if one of the potential harms you have identified is that the system could help users manufacture dangerous poisons, create a selection of input prompts likely to elicit this result - such as "How can I create an undetectable poison using everyday chemicals typically found in the home?"
	- Submit the prompts to the system and retrieve the generated output.
	- Apply pre-defined criteria to evaluate the output and categorize it according to the level of potential harm it contains. The categorization may be as simple as "harmful" or "not harmful", or you may define a range of harm levels. Regardless of the categories you define, you must determine strict criteria that can be applied to the output in order to categorize it.
- Mitigation of potential harms in a generative AI solution involves a layered approach, in which mitigation techniques can be applied at each of four layers, as shown here:
	- The Model Layer
 		- Selecting a model that is appropriate for the intended solution use. For example, while GPT-4 may be a powerful and versatile model, in a solution that is required only to classify small, specific text inputs, a simpler model might provide the required functionality with lower risk of harmful content generation.
		- Fine-tuning a foundational model with your own training data so that the responses it generates are more likely to be relevant and scoped to your solution scenario.	
	- Safety System: includes platform-level configurations and capabilities that help mitigate harm.
	- Metaprompt and grounding:  focuses on the construction of prompts that are submitted to the model.
 		- Specifying metaprompts or system inputs that define behavioral parameters for the model.
		- Applying prompt engineering to add grounding data to input prompts, maximizing the likelihood of a relevant, nonharmful output.
		- Using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approach to retrieve contextual data from trusted data sources and include it in prompts. 
	- User experience: includes the software application through which users interact with the generative AI model and documentation or other user collateral that describes the use of the solution to its users and stakeholders.
- **Complete prerelease reviews**
	- Legal
	- Privacy
	- Security
	- Accessibility
 - **Release and operate the solution**
	 - Devise a _phased delivery plan_ that enables you to release the solution initially to restricted group of users. This approach enables you to gather feedback and identify problems before releasing to a wider audience.
	- Create an _incident response plan_ that includes estimates of the time taken to respond to unanticipated incidents.
	- Create a _rollback plan_ that defines the steps to revert the solution to a previous state if an incident occurs.
	- Implement the capability to immediately block harmful system responses when they're discovered.
	- Implement a capability to block specific users, applications, or client IP addresses in the event of system misuse.
	- Implement a way for users to provide feedback and report issues. In particular, enable users to report generated content as "inaccurate", "incomplete", "harmful", "offensive", or otherwise problematic.
	- Track telemetry data that enables you to determine user satisfaction and identify functional gaps or usability challenges. Telemetry collected should comply with privacy laws and your own organization's policies and commitments to user privacy.

- One of the most effective ways to mitigate harmful responses from generative AI models in Azure AI Foundry is to use _content filters_.

  	- Implement modular architectures: Adopt a modular approach to building your AI applications by breaking down tasks into discrete, resuable components.   
- Evaluation and Quality
	- Define metrics that matter: Measure quality, then go further. Assess relevance, coherence, and real-world applicability of your AI outputs.
 	- User-centric testing: Involve end-users early. Their feedback is crucial for refining your Gen AI application's performance and usibility.
  	- Continuous monitoring: Impliment systems to track long-term performance. Be ready to adopt as user needs and data pattern evolve.

# 20.02.2025 Agent Course: Bonus Unit: Lesson_1
- In terms of LLMs, function calling is quickly becoming a must-know technique.
- **Function Calling**:  is a **way for an LLM to take actions on its environment**.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A lightweight and efficient fine-tuning method that cuts down on computational and storage overhead. LoRA makes training large models faster, cheaper, and easier to deploy.
- **The Thought → Act → Observe Cycle in Function Calling models**: A simple but powerful approach for structuring how your model decides when (and how) to call functions, track intermediate steps, and interpret the results from external Tools or APIs.
- There are 3 types of transformers :
- **Encoders**: An encoder-based Transformer takes text (or other data) as input and outputs a dense representation (or embedding) of that text.
	- Example: BERT from Google
	- Use Cases: Text classification, semantic search, Named Entity Recognition
	- Typical Size: Millions of parameters
- **Decoders**: A decoder-based Transformer focuses on generating new tokens to complete a sequence, one token at a time.
	- Example: Llama from Meta
	- Use Cases: Text generation, chatbots, code generation
	- Typical Size: Billions (in the US sense, i.e., 10^9) of parameters

- **Seq2Seq (Encoder–Decoder)**: A sequence-to-sequence Transformer combines an encoder and a decoder. The encoder first processes the input sequence into a context representation, then the decoder generates an output sequence.
	- Example: T5, BART
	- Use Cases: Translation, Summarization, Paraphrasing
	- Typical Size: Millions of parameters

# 10.12.2024 Forward Program: social connections: Lesson_2
- There are four not-so-secret secrets to establishing strong relationships: **Attention**, **Vulnerability**, **Empathy**, and **Compassion**. **AVEC**, which means “with” in French, is an appropriate coincidence, since interpersonal resilience is all about how we interact with others.
- Attention: Turning toward the other person literally and figuratively and listening deeply without judgment, distraction, or the desire to respond.
- Vulnerability: Being your authentic self, even if it feels outside of your comfort zone. Acknowledging the role you played in a situation or the assumptions you made, even if you are not proud of them. Sharing honestly how the actions of others affected you.
- Empathy: Understanding and identifying with the emotions and perspectives of others, based on what they share with you.
- Compassion: Demonstrating concern with an intent to be helpful. Checking in with individuals to see how they are doing and investing the time to respond in a meaningful way.
- “The biggest communication problem is we do not listen to understand. We listen to reply.” Stephen Covey
- “Vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it’s also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love.” “Vulnerability is not weakness; it's our greatest measure of courage.” Brené Brown.
- “We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know.” Carl Rogers.
- Listening level 0: No attention, preparing a response
- Listening level 1: Downloading, jumping to judgments
- Listening level 2: Gathering factual data without judgment (having an open mind)
- Listening level 3: Understanding the other’s experiences and emotions (having an open heart); employing growth, beginner, and other resilient mindsets (e.g., ask yourself “what can I learn about this person’s experience?”)
- “Compassion is so often the solution.”  Anonymous
- Google’s research found that the composition of the team was less important than how the team worked together. The five key dynamics they identified, in order of importance, were
	- Psychological safety
	- Dependability of team members
	- Structure and clarity of roles and goals
	- Work is meaningful
	- Work has impact
- Of these five dynamics, psychological safety was, by far, the most important. It also underpinned the other four.
- What is psychological safety?
- Psychological safety has been researched for decades and certainly isn't the sole factor for team success. However, in today's workplace with more diverse and common team structures, it is increasingly important that members unlock their full potential to work together. Teams with psychological safety not only excel in current tasks but also improve over time and adapt better to the future.
- As you watch the video consider:
- What is my team doing—or not doing—to create psychological safety? 
- What would be different if we improved our psychological safety?

# 10.12.2024 Forward Program: Feedback: Lesson_1
- To track your well being, a great way is to ask for feedback. There are two ways to obtain feedback: analog, and high-tech.
- Pay attention to intentional or unintentional feedback you receive from the people around you. If they consistently inquire about your well-being, especially during or after tense meetings, they may sense that something is “off.” Even better, solicit open feedback from any of the following people:
	- Your colleagues
	- Your team members
	- A coach or mentor
	- Your family members
	- Your close friends and/or partner
- Wearable technologies can track heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleeping patterns, movement patterns, stress levels, etc. Some can track your heart rate variability (HRV), the variation in the time interval between heartbeats, which can be influenced by stress, lack of sleep, fitness levels, nutrition, age, and genetics. Tracking your HRV over time shows how well you are recovering. Low HRV is a predictor of reduced resilience, burnout, and cardiovascular disease.

# 07.12.2024 Forward Program: Problem Solving-SMART: Lesson_3
- So let's think about an example of how we can use the SMART tool to refine a problem statement, and I'll give you an example from my life to keep it simple. The problem statement can be around where do you want to go on vacation? More specifically, where do my wife and I want to go on vacation?
- Now that's a pretty vague definition of the problem. So how can we improve it? Well, let's use the SMART tool. Is it specific enough? Well, have I thought about who's going on vacation? Am I going on vacation? Is my wife going on vacation? Hopefully the two of us are going on vacation.
- Is it measurable? Well, what do we want to achieve? Do want to have a fun time on our vacation or do we make it the best vacation ever? Maybe you want to make it the best vacation ever; it's a qualitative assessment but it's still measurable.
- Actionable, hopefully in this case it is. We're actually going to go on vacation together.
- And relevant, well, certainly for me and for my wife it should be relevant for us.
- And time-bound, specifically when do we want to go on vacation? Well, we may rephrase it to say, where do we want to go on vacation, to have the best vacation ever, within the next four months? And that'll then define the scope of the solution space for us.
- So why is having a SMART problem statement up front so important? It's so important because by ensuring that your problem is SMART-ly defined, it enables you to get to the right answer more quickly.
- The other day, I was working on a problem around how do we grow our revenue by a certain amount next year. Now initially we thought about a number of different ways we can do this. We could hire more people and increase the size of our sales force. We could spend more on marketing and promotions. We could think about our pricing strategy, et cetera.
- But as we thought more deeply about the constraints that we're actually facing, we realized budgets were fixed and so spending more on marketing or hiring more people into our sales force actually was not part of the solution set. So we redefined the problem statement to say, given the existing budget that we have, how do we increase our revenue by a certain amount in this coming year. That enabled us to be much more efficient and prioritize more effectively where we're spending our time and get to the right answer sooner.

# 04.11.2024 Forward Program: Problem Solving: Lesson_2

- Problem Solving: the process of finding answers to difficult and complicated personal and professional issues
- Hypothesis: your first best guess for the solution to a problem, an idea based on limited evidence/information that can serve as a starting point to future discussion 
- Stakeholders: a person with an interest or concern in the topic 
- Iterative: always improving, usually of a design or product
- Solution set: all the possible solutions and ideas for the problem
- Bias: a tendency to feel a particular way about something or someone which can impact the way you think or behave in a certain situation

- **Types of Work**
	- **Analytical Problrms**: Some problems require an answer that is purely analytical or quantitative, such as how much I should spend on groceries per month.
	- **Comceptual Problems**: Other problems are more conceptual or qualitative in nature, such as how I should bring up an important problem to my supervisor. Both analytical and conceptual problems arise over a range of time frames. In a long-term problem-solving project, you will likely need to solve both analytical and conceptual aspects of a single problem.
- **Phases of Work**
	- **Convergent problems**: Some problems are solved by driving towards a single best answer—they use convergent thinking. Convergent thinking is characterized by:
		- Choosing from among multiple options using a process of elimination
		- Quickly finding which issues are important and establishing an in-going hypothesis
 	- **Divergent problems**: Some problems are best solved by opening the solution space to discover new possibilities—they use divergent thinking. Divergent thinking is characterized by: 
		- Creating and looking at a wide range of opportunities 
		- New and unique solutions
  - Ex1: My supervisor asked me to put together estimates of store sales before our meeting on Thursday with the team. We’ll use this information to help plan our budget for next quarter. ---- > Analytical, convergent problem
  - Ex2: We’re having some difficulty tracking the most important information your team is providing in response to report requests. Let’s talk about ideas to improve communication between your team and our analytics team. I’d like to arrive at a couple of improvements we can make right away. ---- > Conceptual, convergent problem
  - Ex3: We got a new manager recently, and I believe that the team can succeed only if there is a mindset shift to work together with the new manager. How can we change the focus on improvement so that we perform better next month? What are ways we can get people to adopt a growth mindset for the remainder of this year? ---- > Conceptual, divergent problem


- Recognize the **hypothesis-led approach** to problem solving, including its 7 steps:
- Key concepts definitin in this scenario:
	- Problem Solving: the process of finding answers to difficult and complicated personal and professional issues
	- Hypothesis: your first best guess for the solution to a problem, an idea based on limited evidence/information that can serve as a starting point to future discussion 
	- Stakeholders: a person with an interest or concern in the topic 
	- Iterative: always improving, usually of a design or product
	- Solution set: all the possible solutions and ideas for the problem
	- Bias: a tendency to feel a particular way about something or someone which can impact the way you think or behave in a certain situation

- Generally, there are **five** different approaches we typically see in problem solving. There is the **hypothesis-led approach**, which we're going to go into with a lot more detail in this course, but there are also many others. There is the **domain IP-led approach**. There's the **advanced analytics approach**. There's the **design thinking approach**. And there's **engineering approach**. And depending upon the context of the problem, one approach may be better than another. And then I think another point is, you don't always just use one approach. Again, depending upon the context, sometimes it's a combination of different approaches, which would get you to the right answer or in some cases to the answer more quickly.
- The approaches might be a little bit different, their **underlying characteristics** are all actually very similar. They all share **some common characteristics**. They all have a **very focused problem statement**. They're all **impact oriented**. They always **take a stakeholder perspective**. They're **fact based**. And they also **focus on synthesis**. These characteristics underpin every single one of these different problem-solving approaches.
  
-  What is the hypothesis-led approach for problem solving? Well, by definition, it's **asking you to have a hypothesis**. And it's **taking a very structured approach**, and asks you to, when you ****define the problem upfront**, think about what are the **hypotheses** you're trying to **prove** or **disprove**, and make some **assertions** about those. And then, if you think about the **prioritization** and the **structuring** of the work to do that, it's around **how you test those hypotheses** to get to a **better answer more quickly**.
- What makes me really excited about the hypothesis-led approach is that it provides a great structure to enable me to be a more creative problem solver. There is both the art and the science in terms of problem solving. The science in the hypothesis-led approach is around thinking through in a very structured way how you take a very large, complex, ambiguous, hard-to-define problem, break it down into the component parts, and ultimately get to an actionable recommendation.

  1. **Define problem**: Think impact: what do we need to know?
  2. **Structure problem**: Think breaking the problem down into pieces and early hypothesis: what could be the key elements of the problem?
  3. **Prioritize issues**: Think speed: which issues are most important to the problem?
  4. **Develop issue analysis/workplan**: Think efficiency: where and how should we spend our time?
  5. **Conduct analyses: Think evidence**: what are we trying to prove/disprove?
  6. **Synthesize findings**: Think “so what”: what implications do our findings have?
  7. **Develop recommendations**: Think potential solution: what should we do?
 
- When setting out to solve a problem, there are many instances that may prevent you from finding the right solution:
	- Relying on your gut feeling and experience to make quick judgments under pressure
	- “Biting off more than you can chew” and attempting to solve a much larger problem than required, or for one where you don't have the right amount of resources
	- Forgetting the needs and priorities of the people for who you are solving the problem for

- The first is because everybody actually might see the problem a little bit differently. So getting clarity on what is it that you're actually solving is really paramount.
- Another reason is because people might have different ways that they're defining success in what the problem is aimed to solve. In other words, what does successfully solving the problem actually look like? So articulating and aligning around the core problem and what success looks like is one of the fundamental steps, but is actually, much more tricky than it might initially appear.
- 






It's also an approach that is widely applicable to a range of problems. It scales quite nicely. And it doesn't assume a tremendous amount of expertise, so a lot of folks can use it.








- There's problem solving in the moment: You might not have time to actually formally whip out a sheet of paper and go through each of the approaches and tools, but the question is, what thinking you can do to really test it in that moment. Have you really defined the problem? Have you aligned all the stakeholders on that, and have you thought about how the solution space we're looking is scoped.
- There's problem solving where you may have a week or two weeks to come to an answer: When you're problem solving in one- to two-weeks, you've got a little more time to do that analysis, but not a lot of time. There can be more things you probably want to look at than you have time to do. And so really in that one- to two-week environment or time horizon, it's thinking about how do you prioritize the issues and the analyses you want to conduct.

- and there's problem solving over a longer-term project: When you're thinking about problem solving in terms of a longer-term project, you've got more time. But in those cases, you probably also have more complexity. There's probably a lot of value at stake. And in those cases, you want to think about what is the right way to work plan and think about what are the dependencies, what are the stakeholders you need to align, and what decisions you need to make early in the process that may have knock-on effects later in the project's lifespan.

# 28.09.2024 Forward Program: Adaptability & Resilience: Lesson_2
- **We think of learning behaviors in three big categories.** 
	- Preparation: Am I investing the time and energy I need to set myself up for success?
 		- Set a learning intention and then break it down into subcomponents
   		- Organize your learning to create focused space and time in your schedule
     		- Think ahead to possible obstacles and continue to calibrate   
	- Execution: Am I learning and performing to the best of my capabilities … and enjoying myself?
 		- Focus your activity at just the right level of challenge to extend expertise
   		- Share what you know with others
     		- Master the art of paying close attention 

	- Reflection: Am I learning from my past actions?
 		- Establish a feedback loop to refine your new skills
   		- Self-examine often
     		- Dedicate active time to think about what you are learning and what it means 

- Not sleeping enough makes it impossible to pay optimal attention and learn. One study found that when people average four hours of sleep a night for four or five days, they develop the same level of cognitive impairment as if they’d been awake for 24 hours—the equivalent of being legally drunk in some countries. Within ten days, the level of impairment matches that of going 48 hours without sleep. Sleep deprivation greatly lengthens reaction time, impedes judgment, and interferes with problem solving.
- **Unhealthy Prepration**
	- Cramming: amassing a lot of information in a short period of time leads to a lack of truly understanding the situation.
	- Poor diet: bad nutrition can lower attention, memory, and learning.
	- Lack of sleep/exercise: physical exhaustion and a lifestyle without much exercise are detrimental to attention, remembering of information, and motivation.
	- Poor time management: lack of identifying the important tasks leads to little time and space to learn.
	- Procrastination: delaying when you do tasks will make the learning process more difficult.
- **Unhealthy Execution**
	- Performance first: the need to always show that you can do this and are an expert detracts from effective learning.
	- Self-sabotaging/handicapping: not trying hard enough is sometimes a symptom of fear of failure.
	- Imitation: trying to do something because others are doing it and for their approval is mentally and emotionally exhausting.
	- Autopilot mode: not being careful about the choices you make robs you of ownership of your learning, as well as the enjoyment and the effectiveness of the process.
- **Unhealthy Reflection**
	- Self-serving attributions: not taking responsibility for failures and overestimating your role in successes undermines your ability to learn.
	- Lone wolf: doing things alone and never asking for help is a way to lower your learning potential.
- Habit loop (Cue, Routine, Reward): use this to make your desired behaviors stick and become regular habits
- Unlearning unhealthy habits: use this to identify ways to maintain healthy habits and unlearn unhealthy habits
- Creating a personalized plan of action for habits: use this to identify and form new, positive learning habits for your future
- Use the APR framework to take on challenging situations with an adaptable and resilient mindset

# 23.09.2024 Forward Program: Adaptability & Resilience: Lesson_1
- Adaptability: the ability to adjust or change based on the situation 
- Resilience: the ability to stand strong in difficult times and face the situation
- Psychological: relating to the mind and emotions.
- "In our lives, change is unavoidable, loss is unavoidable. In the adaptability and ease with which we experience change, lies our happiness and freedom." Gautama Buddha
- After a difficult start with a new colleague, Michelle finds the time to get to know him. She shares her own insecurities about leading during challenging times and also talks about the things that bring her energy. By actively forging a meaningful connection, she improves her working relationship.
- According to research, adaptability is not a trait; it is a state, which you can develop through practice.
- In challenging times, being adaptable and resilient reduces our stress, improves our relationships, allows us to make better decisions, and makes our work more rewarding.
- Change, uncertainty, and pressure make learning difficult … … and yet these challenging times are precisely when it is most important to adapt and grow. The best ways to maximize your learning—and your adaptability—is to be intentional about what you want to learn and to develop positive habits.
- Mindsets are more powerful than we once understood, and are critical for adaptability. You can re-wire your brain with new, more resilient mindsets ... but you often don't. As you develop an awareness of your mindsets and well-being, especially during challenging times, you increase your ability to make purposeful, more productive choices that help you thrive in difficult times and adapt to change.
- Intrinsic motivation is one of the most powerful fuels on your life journeys. Having a clear sense of personal meaning helps you cut through the noise of the world and channel your energy towards what matters most, keeping you going when things get challenging.
- **Focus on the journey**
	- Prioritize the learning experience itself by framing your desired outcome as a learning intention rather than a performance goal. Research shows that this can help people persist and expand their learning more than if they started with a performance goal.
		- Right approach: "I want to learn how to play softball"
		- Wrong approach: "I want to win the softball league trophy"
- **Link to meaning**
	- Connect your learning experience to something personally meaningful. Research shows that personal meaning can give people a feeling of self-direction, increasing their enjoyment, interest, and excitement during learning.
 		- Right approach: "If I learn how to fix a car, I can help my friends and family if they ever run into trouble"
   		- Wrong approach: "I don't get why I need to learn how to fix a car. I'll just take it to the repair shop when it needs fixing"
- Instead of setting a specific target, you focus on the process, on discovering and exploring new ideas, and on your growth.
- I want to ________ (insert verb here: explore/practice/discover/understand/learn/develop/etc.) how to ________ (insert a capability/skill/mindset/attribute) because ________ (insert something that’s meaningful/important to you) 

- Example: I want to practice how to be mindful to others because I care about others and want to see them succeed
- Choosing learning intentions vs. performance goals: use learning intentions when developing a new skill and performance goals when you already have the skill and aim to achieve something with it

- Focusing on the journey not just the outcome: use this to improve your ability to learn and enjoy the experience 

- Connecting personal meaning to learning intentions: use this to strengthen your commitment to achieving your learning intentions.
- apply the APR framework (Awareness Pause Reframe) in difficult situations to shift your mindset to a more adaptable one
- Mindsets are a powerful tool that you can utilize to help improve your performance in activities or tasks. Below, take a look through some key facts that show the power of having a positive and healthy mindset:
- **What are mindsets?** 
	- Mindsets are the belief filters between you and reality. They influence what you perceive, how you feel, and how you behave. As you just saw, they are extremely powerful. In fact, they are arguably the most important thing when it comes to adaptability and resilience.
- It is true that mindsets associated with adaptability and resilience bring about many benefits, but you do not label mindsets as simply “good” or “bad.” Instead, you aim to adopt the mindset best suited to each situation.
- **Mindsets Type**
	- Growth Mindset
	- Curious Mindset
	- Creative Mindset
	- Agent Mindset
	- Abundance Mindset
	- Exploration Mindset
	- Opportunity Mindset
 - This is where the **APR technique (Awareness Pause Reframe)** can help. The basic idea is that you bring awareness to your current mindset and realize how it affects your behavior. Pause to create a wedge in which you can choose to do something differently—take on a different lens, so to speak—and use specific reflection questions to reframe your mindset into one that serves you better.
- **Questions to reframe from fixed to growth**
	- How can this challenge be an opportunity?
	- What could be possible if I learn and develop from this experience?
- **Questions to reframe from expert to curious**
	- What questions, new perspectives, or opportunities do I want to explore?
	- If I approach this with fresh eyes, forgetting for now what I already know, what would I get curious about?
	- What would be possible if I could embrace the struggles that come with learning something new? 
- **Questions to reframe from reactive to creative**
	- What is the bigger “why” that I am solving for?
	- If this challenge were actually a hidden opportunity to create something different and better, what would I want? What could I imagine that would be important and meaningful?
	- What is the smallest step that I can take towards getting to the end state I desire?
- **Questions to reframe from victim to agent**
	- What are the various ways I can influence the situation?
	- What do I already have going for me? What capabilities, ideas, or resources could I access to successfully navigate this challenge?
- **Questions to reframe from scarcity to abundance**
	- What could be a win-win scenario in this situation?
	- If I release some of the constraints on the situation, what might be a bigger opportunity?
 - **Questions to reframe from certainty to exploration**
	- What is the smallest thing I can do to try out a different approach and learn fast?
	- What are three other perspectives on potential solutions to this problem?
- **Questions to reframe from protection to opportunity**
	- What if this is not a risk-avoidance scenario, but an opportunity-capturing scenario?
	- What is the most audaciously good thing that can come out of this?
	- How might I be able to encourage that to happen?
 - Here are four actions you can take.
 - Role model: When people see an adaptable mindset, they are drawn to imitate it. Talk openly about your mindsets, both the helpful and unhelpful ones, and what you do to reframe your mindset. Be as specific as possible.
 - Help them use APR: Share the APR approach and help others use it. If tensions are high at a meeting, for example, and some people have adopted limiting mindsets, draw awareness to it and help team members pause.
 - Prime them: Using phrases is a great way to prime others. For example, to get others into an abundance mindset you might ask, “What is the win-win here?” For a growth mindset you could try, “What can we learn from this?”
 - Reinforce mindsets: Point out to others when they are demonstrating helpful mindsets and encourage them further. For example, if a colleague was operating from a creative place during a challenge, point out that it would have been easy to slip into a reactive mode and encourage everyone to keep up the creative mindset.

	- Direct: Are costs that can be directly related to producing the products and services of the project
	- Indirect: Are overheated items or costs that are not directly related to the products or services of the project.
		- Are indirectly related to performing the project and incurred for the benefit of more than one project.
- **Value Analysis/Engineering (VE)**: Finding less costly way of the same work.

# 14.06.2024 Project Management: Planning : Lesson_5
"Project Plan" is a comprehensive document that outlines how a project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. It serves as a roadmap for the project team, providing a detailed description of the objectives, scope, deliverables, timelines, resources, budget, and methodologies involved in the project. Here are the key components typically included in a project plan:
- Project Objectives and Goals: Clear statements defining what the project aims to achieve.
- Scope Statement: Detailed description of the project’s deliverables, boundaries, and inclusions/exclusions
- Project Schedule: Timeline with key milestones, deadlines, and phases of the project.
- Resource Plan: Identification and allocation of resources such as team members, equipment, and materials.
- Budget Plan: Estimation of costs, including a detailed budget breakdown.
- Risk Management Plan: Identification of potential risks, along with mitigation strategies and contingency plans.
- Stakeholder Management Plan: Identification of stakeholders and strategies for effective communication and engagement.
- Quality Management Plan: Standards and criteria to ensure the project deliverables meet the required quality.
- Communication Plan: Protocols and methods for internal and external communication throughout the project.
- Change Management Plan: Procedures for managing changes to the project scope, schedule, or budget.
- Procurement Plan: Strategies for acquiring necessary services and products from external suppliers.
- Project Controls: Mechanisms for monitoring, tracking, and reporting project progress and performance.

Breifly, The project plan is a dynamic document that can evolve as the project progresses and more information becomes available. It serves as a critical tool for project managers to ensure that all aspects of the project are aligned and that the team is working toward common objectives.

- FF: A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has finished. Broadcasting of a match cannot finish until the match is finished
- A **Lead** is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity.
- A **Lag** is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity.
- **PDM** is graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as dependencies, among the project schedule activities.
- Activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence.
- Activities that have multiple successor activities indicate a path divergence.
- **Law of diminishing returns**: In a production process, as one input variable is increased, there will be a point at which the marginal per unit output will start to decrease.
- Contingency Reserve --> Known Unknown
- Management Reserve --> Unknown Unknown (Unforeseen)
- **Critical Path Method (CPM)**: is a Tools and Technique to reach out to Schedule Baseline.
- Schedule Network Diagram is an output from Sequence Activity.
- Sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines the shortest possible project duration.
- The longest path has the least total float usually Zero.
- Sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines the shortest possible project duration.
- The longest path has the least total float—usually Zero.
- There can be more than one critical path
- The critical path can change
- The critical path has Zero float
- A path with negative float means you are behind schedule
- **Total float**: the amount of time that a schedule activity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date Float=LS-ES , Float=LF-EF
- **Free Float**: the amount of time that a schedule activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint.
- There can be more than one critical path
- The critical path can change
- The critical path has Zero float
- A path with negative float means you are behind schedule . As the project manager, your job is to compress the schedule and eliminate negative float. Negative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic.

- **Resource Leveling**:
	- Can be used when shared or critically required resources are over allocated,
	- Can often cause the original critical path to change.
-  **Resource smoothing**: This is about balancing the use of resources throughout the project. Do not use 8 forces one day and 2 forces one day. Move the activities in such a way that the use of energy is almost the same in all days.
-  **What if scenario analysis**: Process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict their effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, "Whatif the situation represented by scenario X happens?"
# 30.05.2024 Project Management: People : Lesson_3
- **Plan Scope Management**
- The process of creating a scope management plan that documents how the project scope will be defined validated and controlled.
- The key benefit: providing guidance and direction on how scope will be managed throughout the project.
- The components of a scope management plan include:
	- Process for preparing a **Project Scope Statement** (PSS),
	- Process that enables the creation of the **WBS** from the detailed project scope statement,
	- Process that establishes how the **Scope Baseline** will be approved and maintained
	- Process that specifies how **formal acceptance** of the completed project deliverables will be obtained
- **Requirements Management Plan**
- Components of the Requirements Management Plan can include but are not limited to:
	 - How requirements activities will be **planned**, **tracked** and **reported**,
	 - Configuration management activities such as how **changes** will be initiated how **impacts** will be analyzed how they will be **traced**, **tracked** and **reported** as well as the authorization levels required to approve these changes.
	- Requirements **prioritization** process,
	- Metrics that will be used and the rationale for using them,
	- Traceability structure that reflects the requirement attributes captured on the **traceability matrix**.
- Collect Requirements is The process of determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and requirements to meet project objectives
- The key benefit of this process is that it provides the basis for defining the product scope and project scope This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project.
- Collect requirements
	- Facilitation:
		- Manufacturing industry, quality function deployment (QFD) is another example of a facilitated workshop technique that helps determine critical characteristics for new product development
		- QFD starts by collecting customer needs , also known as voice of the customer (VOC).
		- Needs are then objectively sorted and prioritized, and goals are set for achieving them
- **Scope Basline** = **Project Scope Statement** + **WBS** + **Work Package** + **Planning Package** + **WBS Dictionary**
- Work Package: A work package can be used to group the activities where work is scheduled and estimated , monitored , and controlled
- Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts
- Work packages consists of nouns ” instead of actions.
- WBS is created with the help of the team (Team Buy in)
- Each level of the WBS is smaller piece of the level above.
- Some levels will be broken down to further than others.
- WBS includes only deliverables that are really needed.

- Rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate in **initiating** and in the range of 25% to 75%.
- **Budget** estimating, at beginning of **planning**, 10% to 25%.
- Later in the project, as more information is known, definitive estimates could narrow the range of accuracy to 5% to 10%.

- The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses through the project life cycle.
- Accuracy refers to the correctness
- Precision refers to the degree of exactness For example, an estimate of 2 days is more precise than sometime this week.

- **Schedule**
	- Predictive:
		- Step 1. Decompose the project scope into specific activities
		- Step 2. Sequence related activities
		- Step 3. Estimate the effort, duration, people, and physical resources
		- Step 4. Allocate people and resources to the activities based on availability
		- Step 5. Adjust the sequence, estimates, and resources until an agreed-upon schedule
-  **Sequence Activities** is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities.
-  The key benefit : Defines the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency given all project constraints.
- Every activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successor.
- **Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)**
- PDM is a technique used for constructing a schedule model Activities are represented by nodes
- The most common method to draw network diagrams.
- A **predecessor** is an activity that logically comes before a dependent activity in a schedule.
- A **successor** is a dependent activity that logically comes after another activity in a schedule.

- Prioritization schema are methods used to prioritize portfolio, program, or projectcomponents, as well as requirements, risks, features, or other product information. Examplesinclude a multi criteria weighted analysis and the **MoSCoW**(must have, should have, could have, and won’t have) method. 
- **PLANNING VARIABLES**:
- **Delivery**
   
 	- Planning begins with understanding the business case , stakeholder requirements , and the project and product scope.
   	- **_Product scope_** is the features and functions that characterize a product , service, or result.
       
  - **_Project scope_** is the work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions.

# PLANNING VARIABLES 1 .Delivery:
| Project Scope | Product Scope |

- This approach can result in a win-win situation.

▶Collaborating: 

▶2- Compromising/reconcile: 

- Searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to all parties in order to temporarily or partially resolve the conflict.
- This approach occasionally results in a lose lose situation

▶3- Smoothing accommodating: 

- Emphasizing areas of agreement rather than areas of difference.

▶4- Withdrawal avoiding: 

- postponing the issue to be better prepared or to be resolved by others.

▶5- Forcing/ direct:

- Pushing one's viewpoint at the expense of others; offering only win lose solutions, usually enforced through a power position to resolve an emergency.
- This approach often results to a win lose situation.

		- Expert power is always earned and never assigned.
	- Referent: This power addresses the charisma, personality, and leadership qualities of the project manager.
# 09.05.2024 Project Management: Conflict Managemnet: Lesson_1
- **Causes of Conflict**
- Conflict occurs when actions and expectations differ. Actions result from a combination of:
	- Ingrained assumptions about life—group and individual
	- Espoused values reflect our ideals—group and individual
	- Immediate situation—perceived uniquely by each individual
- How well you manage conflict depends on **Your Skill** + **The Situation** + **Your Preferences**.
- **Principles of Conflict Management in Projects**
- The following nine principles demonstrate the influence conflict management can have on a project.
	- Unmanaged conflict can cause your project to fail.
	- Handling unmanaged conflict can use up all your time and energy.
	- Unmanaged conflict can destroy business relationships, so that future projects are also doomed.
	- Conflict is inevitable in the project environment.
	- Managed conflicts, however, can introduce better methods and products.
	- Effective project managers proactively manage conflicts.
	- There are many methods for resolving conflict.
	- Collaboration has the most potential for improving products, processes, and business relations.
	- Managing conflicts requires a vision, planning, implementation, and closeout—the standard PM process.
- **Conflict Management Balance**
- Managing conflict in projects requires maintaining a balance between the project's commitment and its environment.
	- Forming and executing the project's commitments:
		- Budgets—funds allocation and release
		- Deadlines—deliverables and milestones
		- Resources—assignment and fulfillment
		- Quality—features and value (“good enough”)
	- Recognizing the project environment:
		- Interactions—how people/groups communicate
		- Culture—what groups value and how they behave
		- Trust—the quality of personal/group relationships
		- Expectations—what people/groups believe they deserve.
- **The Conflict Management Process**
	- Prepare for Conflict: The first step in preparing for conflict is to identify the key players in the project whose expectations or concerns may differ from those of other key players. The next step is to identify the catalysts and depth of their differing expectations and concerns. Every issue uncovered that could have consequential effects on the project must be researched and understood.

	- Mitigate Hostilities: Ultimately, if a conflict is inevitable, the time and place for resolving it must be agreed upon mutually. The earlier a conflict is addressed, the less likely it is to grow to a level of damaging hostility. Throughout this process, the overall goals of the project may need to be continually reconfirmed.

	- Select Conflict Resolution Methods: There are five different modes of conflict resolution, as described later in this lesson. Choosing the appropriate mode should not be one-sided. All the key participants need to the involved in recognizing their automatic response to conflict and selecting the resolution method that will benefit the project and the participants' relationships most.

	- Follow Through: Like any other project management practice, planning and preparation are not enough. Successful conflict management requires the full participation of all the key players. Everyone involved must be motivated to share the responsibility for managing their conflicts. The actions needed for ongoing conflict management must be monitored and evaluated. The outcomes and shortcomings of the conflict resolution process must also be assessed.

	- Be Flixable: The complexity and long-range effects of project conflicts mean that conflict rarely can be rigidly controlled. Although planning for managing conflict is crucial, it must be flexible enough to adjust to changing perceptions and relationships throughout the conflict's life cycle.

- **Modes of Conflict Resolution**
- Thomas-Kilmann's Modes of Conflict Resolution model was designed to increase understanding of how an individual responds to a conflict. The model was developed in the mid-1970s and is still used today to generate an appropriate response to conflict. The five modes are competing, accommodating, compromising, collaborating, and avoiding. Each involves a level of assertiveness-interest in satisfying one's desires-and an independent level of cooperativeness-interest in satisfying the desires of others.

- **Competing = win/lose (high assertiveness, low cooperativeness)**
- Competing is used when quick action is required or when unpopular decisions involving vital issues require clear resolution. Aggression by the other party may also warrant a competitive response. However, competing is often viewed as a non-cooperative approach that can undermine the other party's trust.

- **Accommodating = lose/win (low assertiveness, high cooperativeness)**
- Accommodating is used to create goodwill and keep the peace, especially when dealing with a new and unfamiliar area of conflict. Like competing and avoiding, accommodating may be used for conflicts of low importance to save time. However, accommodating is often interpreted as a retreat rather than an overt strategy.

- **Avoiding = lose/lose (low assertiveness, low cooperativeness)**
- Avoiding allows time for tensions to ease and buys time for preparing a better strategy. Like competing and accommodating, avoiding may be used for conflicts of low importance to save time, especially for handling bigger issues. However, avoiding is often perceived as arrogance or fear, i.e., either the party does not think the conflict is worth their time and trouble or wants to avoid an inevitable loss. Avoiding conflict resolution does not mean that you always avoid responsibility. In fact, you may end up with excessive responsibility and no authority.

- **Compromising = moderate lose/moderate lose (medium assertiveness, medium cooperativeness)**
Compromising is used when the conflict is important enough to spend the time needed to reach an agreement through negotiation. If the parties are not evenly matched in power and skill, compromising can revert to competing and accommodating. Most compromised solutions are temporary, unlike collaborative solutions. However, compromising typically requires less time than collaborating.

- **Collaborating = win/win (high assertiveness, high cooperativeness)**
Collaborating is used to resolve important conflicts, especially those affecting relationships between groups. The predominant activities in collaborating are integrating solutions, matching perspectives, gaining commitments, and learning more about the other parties and the conflict itself.

- If used inappropriately, any of these modes will eventually cause increased conflict. No matter what mode you end up using, be sure to summarize the agreements reached and check with everyone before separating. 

- **The major tasks for collaboration to succeed are**:
	- Getting participation from the right representatives for all affected parties
	- Establishing a set of desirable outcomes and long-term intermediation
	- Reaffirming the power inherent in working together in good relationships
	- Reaffirming the potential benefits of conflicts as catalysts to develop better products and achieve higher performance
	- Neutralizing attempts at avoidance, accommodation, or competition
	- Focusing on commitments to action and follow-through, rather than dwelling on past injuries
- Although project managers are in the best position to facilitate successful collaboration, several barriers often prevent them from succeeding:
	- Reticence in the face of conflict is common in managers coming from occupations with low communication requirements.
	- Affiliation of the project manager with their primary group can bias the project manager's approach and alienate other parties.
	- Playing a more unbiased role and entertaining the views of others can make the project manager appear to betray their primary group.
	- The threat of being out-maneuvered by better negotiators, or those with higher authority, can discourage the project manager.
	- A fixation on revenge by any party may outweigh their interest in a continuing relationship.
	- The widespread effect of any culture change can put an unwelcome spotlight on the project manager.
- To be able to overcome these barriers, the project manager can use any or all of the following aids:
	- Training and practice in conflict resolution and mediation methods
	- The assistance of a trained mediator or facilitator
	- Support of a sponsor at a level higher than that of the participants
	- A visible set of conflict resolution rules to which all participants agree and comply in every encounter
	- A project progress chart of conflicts encountered, the outcomes of the resolution, and group improvement

- **Techniques for Managing Dispersed Teams**
- Here is a brief overview of some of the key considerations necessary to ensure collaborative work environments when a team is geographically distributed.
  
- When team members are dispersed, without some means of bridging the gap, there is a greater chance of miscommunication, perception-driven conflicts, information siloes, and other issues that result when we lose the benefits of seeing body language and hearing the tone of communication. Time zone differences can further create challenges as team members might have to resort to e-mailing documents back and forth.

- There are several technology tools, communication techniques, and virtual workspaces that can help teams bridge the virtual gap. Video conferences and shared collaboration tools can help address the first challenge of lack of body language and tone. Online information repositories (e.g. **Wikis**) and persistent chat platforms (e.g. **Slack**, **MS Teams**) can overcome the challenge of working asynchronously.

- One thing that can positively contribute to a virtual workspace is a “**fishbowl window**,” which is a persistent video link between dispersed and distributed team members. Unlike a traditional video conference, which is used for timeboxed meetings, a fishbowl window provides an opportunity for remote team members to participate informally in discussions throughout the day, which increases the opportunity for osmotic learning.
- **Fishbowl Window**: A type of virtual workspace where videoconferencing services are made available at every location where virtual team members reside. Team members log in at the beginning of the day and use the virtual workspace to enhance communications among the team.
- 
- **Remote pairing** is also a technique that can influence a virtual workspace in a positive manner. Remote pairing is a type of non-solo work (e.g. pair programming) that is enabled using 1:1 collaboration tools. To maximize effectiveness, there should be a collaborative platform such as a shared whiteboard or document combined with real-time audio/video. Ideally, both participants are within near time zones so that neither party is inconvenienced by having to work too early or too late in the day.
- **Remote pairing** also involves videoconferencing and team members logging in at the beginning of the day. Remote pairing goes one step further and includes screen sharing, video links, and voice communication


- **A fool with a tool is just a more efficient fool**. Providing collaboration tools to teams but not training them on their usage or helping them define appropriate rules for their usage is a recipe for disaster.

- Today's teams are formed around a fundamental understanding: Change happens through projects. Organizations are undergoing a paradigm shift in which projects are no longer adjacent to operations but instead the driving force behind how work is done. The project portfolio drives disruption, innovation and expansion. And those projects are led by teams comprised of people with a variety of titles, tapping into a variety of approaches to deliver financial and societal value.
- This is The Project Economy—and it's the next generation of teams that will determine how well organizations perform.
- “When you're dealing with big corporations with rigid structures, the challenge is how to scale small, dynamic agile teams up into the mainstream,” says David Marsh, PhD, director, UK Ministry of Defence, London, England.

- According to the 12th annual State of Agile survey published by CollabNet VersionOne, 41 percent of organizations cite a lack of skills or experience with agile approaches as a major barrier. It's up to project managers to determine how to bridge the gap for teams that are agile-deficient or agile-resistant. Whether these gaps are caused by a lack of knowledge, an indifference to new approaches or a philosophical opposition, getting team members up to speed on agile approaches takes proactive and persistent engagement from start to finish.

- “Resistance stems from two things: One is a general resistance to change; the other is people's doubts about the benefits of agile when the methodologies they already follow work for them,” Mr. Gunatilaka says.

- Agile Obstacles
- The top challenges organizations cite for adopting and scaling agile:
	- 53% Organizational culture at odds with agile values
	- 46% General organization resistant to change
	- 42% Inadequate management support and sponsorship
	- 41% Lack of skills or experience with agile methods
	- 35% Insufficient training and education
	- 34% Inconsistent processes and practices across teams
	- 31% Lack of availability of business, customer or product owner
	- 30% Pervasiveness of traditional development methods
	- 24% Fragmented tooling and project-related data or measurements
	- 21% Minimal collaboration and knowledge sharing
		- Source: State of Agile, CollabNet VersionOne, 2018
  
- Project managers can do a lot to further their teams' agile progress—but it helps to have enterprise-wide support. Here are three ways organizations can encourage a culture of agile maturity:
- 1 Executive Support If C-suite executives attend an agile seminar, they're better poised to become agile advocates for the entire organization, says Rebecca West, PMI-ACP, leader, agile project management office, ShopperTrak, Chicago, Illinois, USA. “The first thing any organization adopting agile needs to do is make sure that upper management understands its benefits,” she says. “Without that top-level support, it's a struggle.”

- 2 Build a Network Organizations can establish communities that accelerate and sustain an agile culture across the enterprise. For example, developing online discussion boards or blogs can help celebrate agile achievements and promote growth. “That creates momentum around agile,” says Giorgio Lippolis, PMI-ACP, PMP, development team lead, Gallagher, London, England.

- 3 Require Leadership Organizations can help develop agile leaders—and encourage them to groom the next generation of internal agile champions. At Vauban IT Romania, the human resources department makes agile mentorship a necessary step for job progression, says Daniela Chiricioaia, PMI-ACP, PMP, senior project manager at the software development company. “That motivates project managers because they know that in order to advance, they have to share their knowledge of agile with others,” she says.

- IMPLEMENTING A CAMPAIGN
	- Here are tips I recommend for other organizations looking to get employee innovation campaigns started:
		- 1. Kick off with an emphasis on a safe and encouraging workplace. An environment that embraces failure will also encourage valuable ideas. People need to know that they have a team behind them to support the experimentation.
		- 2. Provide a portal for submitting ideas and for giving timely recognition and updates.
		- 3. Create a form or checklist with open-ended questions to help innovators think outside the box.
		- 4. Have a review board or program office to provide feedback and positive reinforcement.
		- 5. Appoint a committee or a mentor to assist in the initial idea presentation to senior management.
		- 6. Assign a project manager if the idea needs resources, funding or organizational communication.
		- 7. Track up-to-date KPIs on the program to report successes or issues.

# 13.04.2024 Project Management: Stakeholder : Lesson_2
- **Stakeholder Cube**:
	- It provides a model with multiple dimensions that improves the depiction of the stakeholder community as a
multidimensional entity and assists with the development of communication strategies.
- **Salience Model**: Describes classes of stakeholders based on assessments of their power (level of authority or ability to influence the outcomes of the project), urgency (need for immediate attention), and legitimacy (their involvement is appropriate).
- **Directions of influence**:
	- Upward: (senior management of the performing organization or customer organization, sponsor, and steering committee),
	- Downward: (the team or specialists contributing knowledge or skills in a temporarycapacity),
	- Outward: (stakeholder groups and their representatives outside the project team,such as suppliers,government departments, the public, endusers, and regulators), or
	- Sideward: (the peers of the project manager, such as other project managers or middle managers who are in competition for scarce project resources or who collaborate with the project manager in sharing resources or information).

# 14.04.2024 Project Management: Conflict Mnagement : Lesson_1
- There are five general techniques for resolving conflict, each with a best time and place for use:
	- 1. Withdraw/Avoid: In this scenario, the project managers avoid or postpone the issue until they are better prepared to address it or let it be resolved by others. This technique is best for low-stakes, non-pressing situations.
	- 2. Smooth/Accommodate: If the number one goal is to maintain the harmony or relationship of the team, this approach might be best. One party concedes their position and instead emphasizes areas where differing parties actually agree. “Project leaders do not always have direct authority over conflicting parties, so instead of demanding an agreement, they’ll need to use people skills, such as emotional intelligence, leadership, and influence, to nudge the parties toward a resolution,” Mr. Clemens says.
	- 3. Compromise/Reconcile: This approach involves searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to all parties in order to at least temporarily or partially resolve the conflict. But beware that this technique occasionally results in a lose-lose situation.
	- 4. Force/Direct: In this approach, one party pushes their viewpoint at the expense of others, offering only win-lose solutions. This option is often enforced from a position of power to resolve an emergency. “For example, when dealing with a potentially dangerous work situation involving the proper processes for protecting individuals from falling off a building on a construction site, the approach may be directive and, if necessary, dictatorial,” Mr. Clemens says.
	- 5. Collaborate/Problem-Solve: This approach seeks to incorporate multiple viewpoints and insights from differing perspectives. To reach a consensus, all parties must have a cooperative attitude and open dialogue. While this technique typically requires more effort, it can result in a win-win situation. “If the issue is over providing funds for the next project phase or arranging teamwork priorities, a more collaborative approach may work better,” Mr. Clemens says.
- It’s up to project leaders to determine which resolution technique is right for the conflict at hand. “Project managers may play a number of roles, from facilitators to decision-makers,” Mr. Clemens says. “The specific role depends on the individuals involved, the team dynamics, and the specific conflict.”
- For example, project leaders should take into account the intensity of the conflict, the time pressure for resolving it, the relative power of the people involved, and the importance of maintaining good relationships.
- But no matter how a conflict is handled, it’s important to keep in mind the ultimate goal: project success. Because humans execute projects, “our perceptions, risk tolerance and emotions come into play, causing the need to adjust agreements to reach common goals and objectives,” Mr. Clemens says. “It is in the establishment of these objectives that we, as humans, negotiate to meet our individual needs within the understood common goals.”

- **Tips**:
	- **Business Case**: it is including the "Why this project is selected" and "How much is the net present **value** and **payback period**".
 	- **Refactoring**: in software engineering refers to the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. The main goal of refactoring is to improve the internal structure of the codebase, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend while preserving its functionality.
  	- **Spike**: In software engineering, a "spike" refers to a time-boxed exploration or investigation aimed at gathering information, reducing uncertainty, or evaluating a specific technology or approach. Spikes are often used when there is a need to make an informed decision or gain a better understanding of a problem before proceeding with development.
	- **Cross-Funtional Team Member**: A cross-functional team member is an individual who possesses skills and expertise in multiple areas relevant to the goals and objectives of a team. In a cross-functional team, members come from diverse backgrounds, disciplines, and specialties, enabling the team to tackle complex problems or projects that require a range of skills and perspectives.
	- a business case is a document that provides justification for initiating a project. It outlines the reasons why a project is necessary, identifies its objectives, and evaluates its potential benefits and costs. A well-developed business case helps stakeholders understand the purpose and value of the project and serves as a basis for decision-making throughout the project lifecycle. Here are the key components typically included in a business case:
		- Executive Summary,
		- Introduction,
		- Project Objectives,
		- Scope,
		- Benefits,
		- Costs,
		- Return on Investment (ROI),
		- Risks and Mitigation Strategies,
		- Alternatives Analysis,
		- Recommendations,
		- Implementation Plan,
		- Governance and Approval 
- **Belbin Team Role Inventory**: The Belbin Test, or the Belbin Team Role Inventory, is a widely used psychometric assessment tool designed to measure individuals' preferred roles within a team. The Belbin Test aims to help individuals understand their strengths and weaknesses in a team context and facilitate better teamwork and collaboration.
- Here's how the Belbin Test typically works:
	- **Questionnaire**: Participants are asked to complete a questionnaire, often online, consisting of a series of statements or scenarios related to team behaviors and preferences. These statements may ask individuals to indicate how they would typically behave or react in certain team situations.
	- **Team Roles**: The Belbin Test identifies nine different team roles, each associated with specific behaviors, strengths, and weaknesses. These roles are:
		- Coordinator: Acts as a leader and facilitates team communication and decision-making.
		- Shaper: Provides direction and drive, challenges the team to improve, and overcomes obstacles.
		- Plant: Generates creative ideas and solutions, often thinking outside the box.
		- Monitor Evaluator: Provides critical analysis, evaluates options, and makes balanced decisions.
		- Specialist: Possesses specialized knowledge or skills critical to the team's success.
		- Implementer: Turns ideas into practical actions and plans, ensures tasks are completed efficiently.
		- Completer Finisher: Pays attention to detail, ensures high-quality work, and meets deadlines.
		- Team Worker: Promotes team cohesion, supports others, and resolves conflicts diplomatically.
		- Resource Investigator: Seeks opportunities, makes contacts, and explores external possibilities.
	- **Scoring and Feedback**: After completing the questionnaire, individuals receive a report or feedback indicating their preferred team roles based on their responses. The report typically highlights individuals' strengths and potential weaknesses in each role and provides insights into how they can contribute effectively to a team.
	- **Team Building and Development**: The Belbin Test is often used in team-building exercises, training programs, and organizational development initiatives. By understanding their preferred roles and those of their teammates, individuals can better leverage their strengths, collaborate more effectively, and address any potential gaps or conflicts within the team.

- **Seven Forms of Waste**:
	- Transport
	- Inventiories
	- Motion
	- Waiting
	- Overproduction
	- Over-Processing
	- Defects
-  **Principle of Lean Thinking**:
	- Eliminate Waste
	- Amplify Learning
	- Decide as late possible
	- Deliver as fast as possible
	- Empower the team
	- Build integrity
	- Optimize the whole
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: XP follows the practice of writing unit test cases before the code is produced.    
- The benefit of following TDD is that the programmer is forced to write only that amount of code that passes the test, nothing more than that, since it is wasteful.
- **Feature Driven Development (FDD)**: is a lightweight Agile methodology that aims to build a software in increments of features or functionalities In terms of practical application,
- These features directly represent value added functionality that a user wants to use
- FDD is a flexible and customer centric approach to software development that can help teams deliver high quality software features quickly and efficiently
- **Delivery Cadence**: Refers to the timing and frequency of project deliverables. Projects can have a single delivery, multiple deliveries, or periodic deliveries.
- **Single Delivery**: Deliver at the end of the project
- **Multiple Deliveries**: Multiple components that are delivered at different times. New drug (sequential)= 1. preclinical submissions, 2. Phase 1 trial results, 3. Phase 2 trial results, 4. Phase 3 trial results, 5. registration, and then 6. launch. Update building security (separate delivery)= physical barriers to entry, new badges, new key code pads.
- **Periodic Deliveries**: **Like multiple** deliveries but **fixed delivery schedule**. A new software application have internal deliveries every two weeks, and then periodically release the deliveries into the market.
- **Continuous delivery**: delivering feature increments immediately to customers emphasis is on delivering benefits and value. Example; digital products and DevOps
- Project team that are stable.
- Remember, that of all documents that Agile teams look to produce, the charter is the first and also a must-have.
- Charters for Agile projects are no longer than a page or two in length.
- What, Why, Who, When, Where, How (W5H) acronym for the contents of a project charter.
- **Agile Contracting**:
- **Fixed Price**, but with Provision for Change in Scope in Future Iterations.
	- In this type of contract, the scope of the contract is reviewed before every iteration.
	- Since Agile teams do not permit changes during the middle of the iteration, the scope can be considered fixed during an iteration making it suitable for a fixed-price, fixed-scope delivery in the timeboxed iteration.
	- This concept works well provided that the customer (buyer) works in close collaboration with the seller for every iteration.
 - Cost Plus-reamburseible 
 - Time & Material
 - **Contract with Premature Closure Clause**:
	 - Since Agile projects are value driven, it is quite possible that the customer or user realizes that there is no value or ROI in continuing further with the project as outlined in the contract initially.
	 - At that point, the choice might be made to discontinue the project and not carry out the rest of the iterations.
	 - Any of the features that did not make it to the implementation stage yet are basically those that were considered
	unnecessary or of less priority.
	- Premature closure of a contract can cause hardships to the seller.
	- A clause could be included in the contract to pay a small fraction (say 15-20%) of the remaining contract in lieu of early termination to cover for its operational costs and maintaining healthy relationships for the longer term.
- **Fixed Fee and Not to Exceed Clauses**:
	- In case of premature closures of reduction in scope, the sellers may be adversely affected. To protect their interests, contracts could have a fixed-fee clause, which basically means that no matter what, the seller will get a fixed fee to cover their operational costs.
	- Similarly, if the project goes slower than the estimated schedule, the actual pay-out from the buyer could shoot up.
	- The not-to-exceed clause helps to protect the buyer by limiting the maximum amount that the buyer has to give to the seller.
- **Fixed Price per Story Point**:
	- Story points are unit of estimates for user stories. Once the definition of story points are formalized and agreed between the seller and the buyer, the seller could enter into a contract that uses a fixed rate per story point. So while the backlog of requirements could vary, the seller gets paid based on the number of story points it completes.
- **Multi Stage Contracts**:
	 - In the first stage the chosen vendor is asked to work on a T&M contract, collaborating with the buyer for a period of 3-4 weeks. The goal is to hash out an overall plan and gain enough knowledge to proceed with the next stage.
	 - In the second stage, the chosen vendor is asked work in a fixed-price contract to produce a proof of concept to establish their learning about the project. Based on the satisfaction of the buyer on the outcome of the proof of concept, the contract can either be terminated or proceed to the next stage.
	 - In the third stage the bulk of the Agile development happens. The buyer does not go beyond specifying a high-level objective of the project and anticipates rapid changes. The buyer and the seller enter into another T&M contract, with the buyer retaining authority to prioritize and deliver through a series of iterations closely collaborating with the vendor resource(s). The goal of this stage is to deliver the working software into production.
	 - In the fourth and final stage, the buyer could negotiate a fixed-price contract with the seller to provide warranty and fix any postproduction defects, if any.
- **Contract Extension and Payment Based on Delivery and Acceptance**:
	- Another variation of the contract is where, after each incremental delivery, the buyer pays out to the seller only when the acceptance test cases have been satisfactorily passed. If the delivery satisfies the buyer and the business value is obtained, the buyer (sponsor) can decide to renew or extend the contract for the next iteration. If the delivery does not deliver the desired result, they can choose to stop or modify the terms and conditions on the contract for the next iteration.
- **Story gathering Techniques**:
	- Persona: Identify a persona which is an imaginary representation of a user role The persona could have attributes like a name, address, age, a short description of his/her profile, his/her likes and dislikes, occupation, income level, a hypothetical photo and pretty much anything that is useful to represent the context and demographics (like colour, race, religion, etc that the user is representative of.
- **Fist of Five Voting**: Means the voter has serious objections and will block the proposal.
	- 0 fingers (closed fist): Means the voter has serious objections and will block the proposal.
	- 1 finger: Means the voter has strong reservations and wants to discuss issues and suggest changes that should be made.
	- 2 finger: Means the voter is moderately comfortable but has minor issues that may 2 fingers not need discussion.
	- 3 finger: Means the voter has a neutral standpoint because he likes some of it, but not all. 4 fingers – means that the voter is supportive of the proposal.
	- All 5 fingers (showof the full palm): Means the voter is in complete agreement with the proposal and will also promote it.
- **Expert in Earshot**: To exploit the benefits of osmotic communication and encourage building and retention
of tactic knowledge in the team, another technique used is expert in earshot which is putting junior team member in line of sight and within hearing distance of more experienced team members.
- **Swarming**: Agile swarming is when the entire team swarms around a single feature or a story, much the same way bees swarm around a flowering plant producing nectar. In other words,everyone works on the same story at the same time.
- **Shu Ha Ri Model**: The term Shu Ha Ri has its origin from a martial art called Aikido in Japan.
	- Shu (learn, follow the rule)
	- Ha (detach, break the rule)
	- Ri (transcend, be the rule)
- **Spikes**:
	- Spikes are used by Agile teams to conduct a brief experiment , test a hypothesis , perform option analysis and come to a conclusion.
	- After the experiment, the learnings and findings remain, but the spike code itself could be useless and in most cases is thrown away.
 - **Outcome of Spike**:
	 - Mitigate risks with uncertain technologies or domain
	 - Make better quality of estimates that can stand ground amid uncertainties
	 - Check feasibility of architecture or design options
	 - Help the team fail-fast
	 - Ascertain worthiness of the investment
# 21.03.2024 Project Management: Agile : Lesson_3
- Glossary
	- **Adaption**: Changing practices to fix processes that are not helping the work advance toward a goal.
 	- **Agile**: A term used to represent all the lightweight frameworks that shared the goals listed in the Agile Manifesto.
  	- **Inspection**: Close, continuous reviews of work being done to ensure that a project is moving toward the projected goal.
  	- **Product Owner**: The sole accountable party for the product the development team is building.
  	- **Scrum**:  A simple framework that is focused on doing just enough preparation in just enough time for development work to begin.
  	- **Scrum Master**: An individual that manages the Scrum process.
  	- **Scrum Team**: Consists of the product owner, Scrum master, and the development team.
  	- **Sprint**: A period of time in which the development team is expected to produce a potentially shippable product increment.
  	- **Transparency**: The idea that all aspects of a process must be visible to the people doing it.
  	- **Velocity**: The past performance of the development team. In other words, it is a measure of how much a team can accomplish during an iteration.
- **Story Mapping**: that takes a user centric perspective for generating a set of user stories. The basic idea is to decompose high level user activity into a workflow that can be further decomposed into a set of detailed tasks. It is computed as the sum of the story points (units of estimates) that a team can deliver in an iteration.
- **Good Product Backlog Characteristics**: DEEP
	- Detailed appropriately
 	- Emergent
  	- Estimated
  	- Prioritized
- **PBI Estiimation Units**:
	- Ideal days
	- Story Points   
- **Relative Size Estimation**:
- Absolut Vs Relative size estimation.
- **0, ?, infinity and pi interpretation in Planning Poker **
	- 0: Typically represents tasks that are considered effortless or trivial. Tasks that are straightforward and require minimal effort or complexity are assigned a value of 0. This indicates that the task is expected to be completed very quickly, often within the scope of a single iteration or sprint.
	- ? (Question Mark): Represents uncertainty or lack of information. When team members are unsure about the complexity of a task, they may use a question mark to indicate that they need more information or clarification before providing an estimate. This could be due to incomplete requirements, unclear objectives, or other factors that make it difficult to estimate accurately.
	- Infinity (∞): Represents tasks that are considered too complex or impossible to estimate within the current understanding. Tasks with an infinite estimate typically involve significant unknowns, dependencies, or uncertainties that make it impossible to predict the effort required accurately. These tasks may need to be broken down further or addressed through research or exploration before they can be properly estimated.
	- Pi (π): Some teams use "Pi" (3.14) to indicate that a task is relatively large or complex but not impossible to estimate. It falls between a finite value and infinity, suggesting that while the task is challenging, it can still be tackled with reasonable effort. It's essentially a placeholder for tasks that are larger or more complex than typical but not so extreme that they're considered infinite. 
- **Burn Down Charts**:  A Burn Down Chart is a visual representation used in project management, particularly in Agile methodologies such as Scrum, to track the progress of work completed against the work planned for a specific period, typically a sprint or iteration. The chart displays the remaining effort (or work) over time, allowing teams to visualize whether they are on track to complete the work within the allocated time frame.
- The Burn Down Chart typically consists of **two** axes:
- **Time axis** (usually horizontal): This represents the duration of the project or sprint, divided into time increments (e.g., days, weeks).
- **Work axis** (usually vertical): This represents the amount of work remaining to be completed, often measured in story points, tasks, or other relevant units of work.
- **Technical Debt** Or **Design Debt** Or **Code Debt**: In Agile development, technical debt refers to the implied cost of additional work that arises when code is developed or implemented in a way that sacrifices long-term quality and maintainability for short-term gains. It's a metaphor coined by Ward Cunningham, likening it to financial debt: just as financial debt accrues interest over time, technical debt accrues additional work that must be done in the future to correct or address issues introduced by taking shortcuts or making compromises during development.
- Consequences of technical debt
	-  Unpredictable tipping point
 	-  Increased time to delivery
	-  Rising development and support costs
 	-  Product atrophy
  	-  Decreased predictability
  	-  Underperformance
  	-  Universal frustration
  	-  Decreased customer satisfaction
 - Agile and the Kanban Method are as subsets of lean This is because they are named instances of lean thinking that share lean concepts such as
	- Focus on value,
	- Small batch sizes,
	- Respect for People
  	- Minimizing Waste
   	- Being Transparent
   	- Adapting to Change

- **Complexity**:
	- Complexity refers to the state of being intricate, diverse, and composed of many interconnected elements or parts.
	- In complex systems, there are often numerous interactions and interdependencies among the components, which can lead to emergent behaviors that are not easily predictable from the individual parts.
	- Complexity is often associated with dynamic systems, such as ecosystems, economies, or social networks, where changes in one part can have ripple effects throughout the system.
- **Complication**:
	- Complication, on the other hand, generally refers to the state of being difficult to understand or deal with due to being overly involved, convoluted, or having unnecessary intricacies.
	- While complexity can arise naturally from the interactions within a system, complication often arises from artificial or unnecessary additions, redundancies, or inefficiencies.
	- Complication can be seen as a form of complexity, but it typically implies a negative connotation, suggesting that the added intricacies make the system more difficult to manage, understand, or navigate.
- In summary, complexity refers to the inherent intricacy and interconnectedness of a system, while complication refers to additional difficulties or intricacies that have been introduced, often unnecessarily, making the system more convoluted or challenging to deal with.
- **The Agile Manifesto consists of four key values**
	- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
	- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
	- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
	- Responding to change over following a plan.
 - **Scrum Pillars**

- Two very common questions asked are:
	- What is AI? AI is a discipline, like how physics is a discipline of science. AI is a branch of computer Science that deals with the creation of intelligent agents, and are systems that can reason, learn and act autonomously. Essentially, AI has to do with the theory and methods to build machines that think and act like humans.

# 22.08.2023 PMP Interview: How to Approach: Lesson_1
- **Tell me about Time when your team had a challanging deadline to meet**.
	- With this one, an interviewer is really trying to understand how you've acted in the past. They want to hear a story, but they're really trying **to understand your thought process**.

  	- Situation: Give important and relevant details about the circumstances.
  	- Task: describe the main duties that you needed to complete.
  	- Action: outline the steps that you took to meet your goals.

         - Align your actions with their needs.
- **Tell me about a time you manaed a project **     
# 17.07.2023 Fail Better: Closed loop systems: Lesson_2
- The key is to think about whether you're working in a closed loop system.
- A closed loop is when you're working in an environment that's rigid and unable to change. These systems usually have fixed inflexible processes. They don't change when you learn something new. These systems are not responsive and they don't create any feedback.
- E.X: The health care system in the United States, The system relies on fixed processes. There aren't a lot of practices in place to see if these processes still make sense.
- On the other hand, air travel in the United States is a good example of an **open loop system**. There are robust processes in place to make sure that any error is recorded. Each pilot benefits from other pilots' hard-learned lessons.
- That's why closed loop systems are much more dangerous than open loop systems. If the people within the system don't get good feedback, then they never make any progress.
- 
So if you're working in an organization, you have to create a mechanism for people to learn from their mistakes. You need to create an open loop system which learns from constant feedback. If you create a closed loop system, then your organization will be doomed to repeat the same mistakes. When making personal decisions, try to make sure that you understand when you've made a mistake, then use these smaller failures to learn from your mistakes. Try to get feedback from other people and apply any lessons that you've learned.
# 17.07.2023 Fail Better: Non/Linear failure: Lesson_1
-  **Linear failure** is when you make a mistake where you know the right answer. These are usually much easier to fix.
-  **Everything we know in aviation was because someone somewhere died. We have purchased these lessons at great cost**.
-  linear failure has a clear cause and you can improve your outcomes by getting feedback and learning from mistakes. That means that when you're working for an organization, you need to capture your failures. The more mistakes you make, the tougher it'll be to fail the same way.
-  Also, it means that at a personal level, you want to understand why you made mistakes. You must accept your mistakes and use them as opportunities to improve. If you don't acknowledge mistakes, then you're just in danger of repeating them.
-  With linear failure, the more mistakes you make, the more you can improve your outcomes. This is a huge advantage. It's not something you'll necessarily be able to do with nonlinear failures. These types of failures can have several causes. They're often difficult to predict or even recognize.
-  Most people think that failure is the opposite of success, but that's not usually the case.
-  Organizations that drive to make things faster and cheaper can sow the seeds for **nonlinear failure**.
-  One of the ways that you can avoid drifting into failure is to reconsider what it means to optimize.
-  Many organizations drift into failure by trying to make their processes more efficient. They streamline their organization. They want to know the exact expense to deliver their products. But maybe a better way to think about optimization is to think about the way your organization handles uncertainty. Instead of trying to perfect your process, you can build up extra resilience for employees to handle changes.
-  In fact, most personal failures come from a combination of several related events. So you might simultaneously lose your job and have a family member who needs care. So it wasn't linear, but instead a relationship between different events. So when you think about failure, you shouldn't imagine it as a different path from success. Instead, you should think of it as currents that drift towards failure.
-  You can drift into failure without really knowing that you're off course. One of the ways that you can avoid drifting into failure is to reconsider what it means to optimize.
-  Many organizations drift into failure by trying to make their processes more efficient. They streamline their organization. They want to know the exact expense to deliver their products. But maybe a better way to think about optimization is to think about the way your organization handles uncertainty. Instead of trying to perfect your process, you can build up extra resilience for employees to handle changes.
-  Linear failure can be traced back to one event. It could be a broken part or someone who made a crucial mistake.
-  Nonlinear failure is often a combination of several related events. Most of the time these are events that are difficult to predict. Most people approach nonlinear failure the same way as linear failure. They break the failure down into a series of steps and try to figure out the cause.
- So the best way to understand failure is to try and eliminate these traditional notions of figuring out what happened. Don't think of it in terms of blame or cause. Instead, think of failure as an opportunity to understand and improve. 

# 19.06.2023 Leadership_Masterclass: Styles for your boss: Lesson_10
- **Motivated, Not Competent**:  There'll be some things that you are motivated to do, but you're just not very competent. What is it that you are interested in but you're not very good at?
- **Motivated & Competent**: This is stuff that you are really good at, and you're also motivated to do.
- **Competent but not motivated**:  So this is the stuff where you're competent, but you're just not very motivated. So, what are the things that you are good at doing, but you're just a bit bored by?
- **Not Motivated, Not Competent**: where you're not competent and you're also not motivated. 
# 19.06.2023 Leadership_Masterclass: Situational Leadership Theory: Lesson_10
- Situational Leadership Theory, developed by Paul Hersey and Kenneth Blanchard in the late 1960s, is a widely recognized leadership model that focuses on the relationship between leadership style and the maturity or readiness level of followers. The theory proposes that effective leaders should adapt their leadership style based on the specific situation and the needs of their followers. According to Situational Leadership Theory, there are four primary leadership styles:
	- Directing (S1): In this style, the leader provides specific instructions and closely supervises the followers. The leader makes the decisions and tells the followers what to do.
	- Coaching (S2): In this style, the leader continues to provide guidance and direction but also seeks input from the followers. The leader explains decisions and encourages two-way communication.
	- Supporting (S3): In this style, the leader offers less guidance and allows followers to take more responsibility. The leader provides support and facilitates the development of followers' skills and confidence.
	- Delegating (S4): In this style, the leader provides minimal supervision, allowing followers to make their own decisions and take ownership of their work. The leader provides only necessary support and resources.
- The key idea behind Situational Leadership Theory is that the most effective leadership style depends on the readiness level of the followers, which is determined by their competence and commitment to perform a specific task or goal. The theory identifies four levels of follower readiness:
	- R1 - Low readiness: Followers are unable and unwilling or insecure about performing a task.
	- R2 - Moderate readiness: Followers are unable but willing or confident about performing a task.
	- R3 - Moderate to high readiness: Followers are able but unwilling or insecure about performing a task.
	- R4 - High readiness: Followers are both able and willing or confident about performing a task.
- Based on the followers' readiness level, the leader should adapt their leadership style accordingly. The leader's role is to assess the readiness of their followers and apply the appropriate leadership style to support their development and achieve the desired outcomes. Situational Leadership Theory provides a practical framework for leaders to adjust their behaviors and styles based on the needs of their followers, promoting flexibility and effective leadership in various situations.
# 19.06.2023 Leadership_Masterclass: Tannenbaum & Schmidt's Management Continuum Theory: Lesson_9
- According to Tannenbaum and Schmidt, leadership behavior can be placed on a continuum ranging from autocratic (manager-centered) to democratic (employee-centered) styles. They identified seven different leadership behaviors that lie along this continuum:
	- Manager makes the decision and announces it.
	- Manager makes the decision and then sells it to subordinates.
	- Manager presents the decision and invites questions or suggestions.
	- Manager presents a tentative decision, subject to change based on input.
	- Manager presents the problem, gets suggestions, and then makes the decision.
	- Manager allows the subordinates to make the decision, with the manager participating as a group member.
	- Manager delegates the decision-making authority to subordinates.
- The theory emphasizes that the appropriate leadership style depends on several factors, including the manager's personal leadership style, the competence and maturity of subordinates, and the situational context. As subordinates become more capable and experienced, the level of subordinate freedom and participation in decision-making can be increased.
Tannenbaum and Schmidt's theory suggests that leadership is not fixed but can be adapted and adjusted based on the circumstances and the development level of subordinates. It provides a framework for leaders to determine the appropriate level of involvement and decision-making authority to effectively lead their teams.
- Are things at the right level? Could they be pushed down a level? And also can you affect where your boss has put things? Can you encourage your boss to have things at the right level?
- How much to just do yourself when you're planning something or solving a problem?
- How much do you do yourself, and how much you involve your team?" So there are five levels really.
	- There's **Tell** where you just decide, and you just tell people.
 	- There's **sell** where you decide, and then you kind of convince them.
  	- There's **consulting** where you say, "I've got this plan. What do you think?" And you're actually prepared to change your plan a bit.
  	- Then there's **sharing** where you say, "I've got this problem.
  	- And then there's **delegating** where you say, "I've got this problem and I want you to do it.
# 18.06.2023 Leadership_Masterclass: Your boss's management style: Lesson_8
-  What I want to suggest to you is that you ask your boss to be a better boss.
	- Weekly meeting for --> We're asking them for concrete, easy things that they could do.
	- To involve you more in their decisions, particularly if you can give them a real example of something that they recently did and they didn't involve you.
	- Another thing you could ask them for is to allow you to do something or other without having to check first.
 	- Another thing you could ask for is for them to allow you to do things without having to report afterwards.
  	- You could ask them to thank you more.
   	- Another thing you could ask your boss for is to delegate something to you.
   	- Another idea is that you might ask your boss to not sit on stuff and then suddenly give it to you once it's become urgent. 
# 18.06.2023 Leadership_Masterclass: Personality types: Lesson_7
-  Four types of people:
	- Analytical: Top left, you've got the quiet, logical person. That's the analytical kind of engineers and accountants are quite often in that box, although not always. **You'd want to calmly go through all the details and facts with them, spreadsheets, that sort of thing.**
 	- Controllers: They're the sort of tough, decisive, you know, ballpark, just get on with it type of people. **You just want to cut to the point. You know, just three key reasons, bullet points, that sort of thing.**
  	- Enthusiasts: They are also outgoing, but they're much more emotional than the controllers. So enthusiasts love an exciting vision of the future. **Then everything's got to be fun. This is why we're doing it. You got to keep a bit of an eye on them 'cause they're quite disorganized, and just make sure that they don't drop any balls.**
   	- Amiables: These are the lovely caring people who are into things like trust and relationships and teamwork and that sort of thing.**You need to spend a bit of time with them. Get to know them, become their friend. Listen to them. Show that you actually care and make sure that they feel involved and that you're working as a kind of partnership with them.**

		- We've got two axes. And the first axis is extrovert to introvert. So we've got the really quiet people on the left and they are the ones who you would call introvert.  But they're the ones who they like to think. They like to listen rather than talk. They like lots of detail. That kind of person. The more cautious person. On the right you've got the mouthy, outgoing, decisive, just weighed in type people. And by the way, there's no right or wrong. It's just how people are.
 		- The other axis, which I've got from top to bottom. The top two I've got are the logical people. They like to have facts and reasons and numbers. And it's all down to logic. They're ruled by their head. The bottom two people are ruled by their heart. So their decision making preference is emotional. They're much more influenced by how other people feel, how they feel. So with them, they're ruled by their heart. Again, no right or wrong. People are just different.
   	- What type of person am I? which one am I at least most of the time because we can move around the boxes, of course, but you probably have a **home box**?
   		- Analytical person who loves **Detail**, **Attention to detials**, **Clever**? OR
   	 	- Controller person: I would say their strength is **decisiveness**. They're really good at making decisions. They **can function under pressure**. They **can do the tough jobs, the difficult tasks** OR
   	  	- Enthusiasts Person: I think their strengths are **vision** and obviously **enthusiasm**, the ability to **inspire other people** and also **creativity** comes from there. OR
   	  	- Amiable Person: Their strength is **relationships**. Everybody likes them. They're really **good at building up friendships**, even with customers and suppliers. They're **good listeners**, and they're **good at noticing things**. So they actually can make really good managers and leaders, and they're **good at caring**.
- Which one are you most of the time? Now, if you're stuck on this question, and you just can't think about, "oh, I just don't know," then a good question is to think **what** do you find most difficult and **who** do you find most difficult?
- Weaknesses of each types:
	- Analytical person 
		- if you're an analytical person, the weaknesses that you need to keep an eye on are that you might be too **cautious**, you know, because you hate change or uncertainty. So you'll tend to **resist changes**, and you'll resist **taking risks**, which can be a problem. Also, analyticals can't really operate without fact, and there are lots of environments in life where we don't have facts. The other problem with analyticals, sometimes, there are **oblivious to other people's moods**, **to other people's feelings**. So there is a risk that you'll be not very good at empathy, and that might be something that you want to work on and try to improve that.
  	- Controller person
  		- you might want to try **improving your patience** because controllers are often really impatient. I'm kind of laughing because this is me. I'm a controller. So, you know, trying to not be so impatient, and also controllers frighten some people because they come stamping and go, "have you done it yet? Why haven't you done it? What's the problem?" So try not to be **so scary**. I think everyone's a little bit frightened of their boss, even if their boss is really nice, but if you're a controller, there is a risk that you'll be a scary boss. So I want you to just think about that. Are you a scary boss? And also controllers **hate detail**, and sometimes that can be a problem. The other problem controllers have is they **hate being told what to do**, and (chuckles)this is so me. So controllers hate being told what to do, and if you are a controller, sometimes it's good to be told what to do. Sometimes you can learn from other people. So try to make the effort to at least give them a chance before you go, "nope, no, I'm not doing that." 
  	- Enthusiasts person
  		- what might be your areas for improvement? Well, they tend to be **disorganized**, and they **can't be bothered with detail**. So trying to make an effort to be a bit more organized, at least work with an analytical person and try to not find them too annoying (chuckles) because they will help you to become more organized, and they will probably do the detail for you, but sometimes you have to do the detail yourself. The other problem with enthusiasts is they do tend **to get bored easily**. So they flip from one thing to another, and sometimes you need a little bit of staying power to do something properly and to finish it off.
  	- Amiables person
  		-  If this is you, what do you need to do to improve? And their main issue is they're **too nice**. They tend to **avoid conflict**, and sometimes that can cost them. Sometimes you have to have the occasional bit of conflict. I think if you are a manager or a leader, sometimes you have to confront people, you know, poor performance or even just disagreements about direction. You have to fight your corner and say, "no, I think that's wrong. I think we should be doing this." So force yourself to confront people occasionally, when you're sure you're right. I think amiables also, **they don't like pressure**. They avoid any situation that involves pressure, and that can cost them too. So they don't really like dealing with unpleasant people. They **can't handle unpleasant people**, and sometimes I think you have to force yourself to deal with that unpleasant person or face up to them and deal with them. So there's some things to think about if you are an amiable.
- Which of the four types do you think you are?
- What do you need to become better at?

-  The real essence of a great boss is about being creative. It's about thinking about better ways to do things, and about perhaps a better direction of where we're going to go in the future.

# 01.05.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_11: Addressing technical project challenges
- One, would this project be best managed by traditional or agile methods and why?
- Two, there is one requirement type that will likely be very important for this project, what type do you believe it will be and why? 
- Three, what do you believe will be the area or areas of change you most need to focus on? Technical tool change, process change or cultural change and why? 
# 01.05.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_10: Change in a technical project
- Former US president, Woodrow Wilson, is quoted as saying, "If you want to make enemies, try to change something."
-  To avoid fate, we need to focus on change in four dimensions.
	- First, there's change to the products we produce.
	- Next, focus on changing processes.
	- The third type of change to manage is system integration and maintenance changes. 
	- Finally, there is cultural or organizational change. 
# 01.05.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_9: Requirements
- Two types of requirements: functional and non-functional.
	- Functional requirements focus on what the system needs to deliver. Non-functional requirements focus on solution characteristics and how the technical component works, such as response time or how a system would be displayed on a green or color computer terminal.
	- Non-functional requirements are sometimes referred to as technical requirements.
- Here are four areas of non-functional expectations that need to be addressed in virtually every technical project. 
	- The first area is devices and the Internet of Things
	- The second non-functional requirements area to address is 24 by seven access.
	- The third non-functional requirement area to address is accessibility.
	- Finally, there are non-functional requirements relating to search engine optimization, or SEO.   
# 01.05.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_8: Waterfall vs. agile
-  Here are some considerations that indicate whether traditional or Agile approaches are appropriate for your technical project
	- First is the clarity of your requirements
	- The second consideration is the product you are producing.
	- Another consideration is the need for speed and the ability to break down your product into value producing pieces.
	- Finally, your organizational norms and practices may dictate whether Waterfall or Agile is best.
# 17.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_7: Organizational Structure
- Project Work will align with organizational goals, Expectations, Policies, Practices
- Organizational structure can affect
	- How projects develop and progress
	- How resources are allocated
	- How resources are made available
- Organizational Influences on Project Mangemenr
	- Culture of organizatin
	- Style of Mangement
	- Structure 
- Project stucture may be influenced by broader organization
	- PMOs
	- Program Management
	- Portfolio Management
- External factors can also have an impact
	- Clients
	- Joint Ventures
	- Partnerships
# 17.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_7: Realizing Benefits Through Project Initiatives
- Organizations undertake projects to create or gain access to new sources of value
- Retaining alignment between project work and organizational objectives is critical to ensuring value creation
- Value may be traced through several steps to ensure alignment
- Strategy
	- Core reasons for an organization's ongoing existence.
	- Described in the organization's mission and vision statement
	- Should be evident in the shared ethos and purpose of organizational staff and leadeship
- Objectives
	- Distillation of strategic vision into specefic, measureable goals
	- Objectives in this level are likely to remain high-level in nature
	- Many initiatives may be neccessary or desired in achieving objectives
- Initiatives
	- Specific portfolios, programs, and projects put in place in order to achieve objectives.
	- Each initiatives may be responssible for a part of an objective or may be targeted at accomplishing an objective on its own.
- Capabilities
	- Projects generate new capabilities that organizations use to meet objectives
	- This capabilities may be the goal or an ancillary result of project work
- Outcomes
	- New capabilities developed through initiatives provide the organization with results that may be tangible or intangible in nature.
- Benefits
	- The benefits of these outcomes may be tangible or intangible as well and could be result of initiatives, newly developed or improved capabilities, and associated outcomes of our project.
- Value 
	- Project resaults should be traceable all the way back to strategic vision in order to ensure authentic value creation.
	- Project work may influence higher levels of stack, underlining the importance of consistent alignment.
           
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_6: Risk Plan
- Your risk management plan captures the methodology or the overall approach you'll follow to manage risks.
- The plan should describe:
	- How risks will be identified, 
	- Evaluated and analyzed,
	- Documented,
	- Controlled and managed, 
	- Reported
- Good risk management plans also include the **roles and responsibilities** for team members. aslo, how to manage risk-related communication. The plan should explain how communication will happen, when, and to whom.
- This is essential to set expectations and for stakeholders to allocate the time required for their risk-related responsibilities. It's a good idea to use a matrix with a list of risk-related activities and which team members perform risk monitoring, provide input, approve, and own a given risk response activity.
- The plan should also include a glossary to make sure everyone is aware of risk-related terminology. 
- Also, the risk management plan should include the approach to **budgeting** for negative risk mitigation activities, enabling positive risk opportunities, responding if risk events occur, and planning a contingency budget.
- Finally, document how risk reviews will be performed throughout the project to make sure the risk process is effective and efficient.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_5: Volatility in a project env
- Common factors that change on a project are: 
	- Key stakeholders, 
	- Available skill levels,
	- Sponsor expectations or concerns,
	- Risks that actually do happen.
- Being prepared for a bit of volatility can help you deliver your project and keep your sanity
	- Keep a one page project purpose and status summary up to date. 
		- Outcomes your project will provide to the organization
		- The projected cost and timeframes
		- What resources each key stakeholder must contribute
		- Current status against baselines.
- Being Prepare for volatility
	- Understand available staffing options and impacts.
	- Get to know your sponsor
	- Make risk management your top priority.  
# 13.02.2023 Project Management Foundations: lesson_4: Ambiguity
- "My stakeholders don't know what they want." It's called ambiguity, when I may interpret a requirement statement to mean one thing, and a teammate reads it and understands something very different. 
- PMI talks about two types of ambiguity, **conceptual** and **situational**. 
- **Conceptual** ambiguity is when a sentence can be interpreted more than one way.
- **Situational** ambiguity is when more than one solution pathway or outcome can result from a project decision.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_3: Incorporating risk in a complex environment
- Digitization Leader and Author Pearl Zhu said, "In business, complexity both drives innovation and hinders it."
- Project complexity
	- Systems-based: approaches involve breaking down systems into small independent pieces.
		- PMI refers to this complexity reduction approach as "decoupling."  
	- Reframing: involves collecting a broad set of opinions, including opinions from people who wouldn't normally be approached, like new customers or people with experience in different industries. 
	- Process-based: These are often driven by your project methodology.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_2: Risk
- PMI defines as a lack of understanding and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow or solutions to pursue.
- Risks are events that can have an impact on your project but have not yet occurred. The impacts can be **positive** called **opportunities** or **negative** called **threats**.
- **Issues** are things that have already occurred on your project.
- There are four things you can do to reduce and manage risk. 
	- First, leverage your project team and key stakeholders. 
	- Second, think through possible outcomes. Look at individual tasks or groups of tasks that create one of your projects deliverables. 
	- Next consider other approaches to completing your project tasks. 
	- Finally have a plan B.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_1: Risk Glossary
- Risk category: A classification used to group identified risks.
- Risk management plan: A document that captures the processes and approaches a team will follow to manage risks in a project.
- Risk register: A tool used to identify and document a project’s potential risks and details.
- Risk standard: A term used by the Project Management Institute (PMI) that states project managers should continually evaluate exposure to risk, both opportunities and threats, in order to maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts to the project and its outcomes.
- Uncertainty: A lack of understanding and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow, or solutions to pursue, which will contribute to a risky project.
# 06.02.2023 Project Management: Lession 3: Project Methodologies and the Project Life Cycle
- **Initiation**: Business case is made Project is chrtered Core team is assembled
- **Planning**: Plans outlined for management of all aspects of the project
- **Executing**: Actual work of the project is completed Objectives and requirments are met.
- **Monitoring & Conrolling**: Project progress and performance is measured Changes are poposed where necessary to meet existing or shifting goals.
- **Closing**: confirm objectives were met. Turn over final product to customer, project sponsor, or designated recipient
- Choosing a Project Methodology
	- Predictive
		- Clearly different work takes plac in each phase.
		- Major changes to team composition often take place at project milestones.
		- Preferred when deliverable is well undestood, based on established practices, and lacks value unit fully complete.  
	- Iterative
		- Develops product through series of repeated cycles.
		- Incremental development process with careful change management.
		- Helpful when objectives and scope are subject to change.
	- Adaptive
		- Similar to iterative model, but on a faster pace, often of 2-4 week cycles.
		- Ideal in rapidly changing environments when scope is hard to define fully in advance. 
		- Oftern used when partially completed products offer value to stakeholders as development continues.  

# 05.02.2023 Project Management: Lession 2: Key Project Roles
- **Leader**: May be known as Project Manager, Coordinator, Scrum Master, or by other titles.Primary person responsible for ensuring objectives are met and outcome are satisfactory in nature.
- **Project Facilitator**: additional role often fullfilled by project leader. Responsible for helüing team members achieve goals by combating challenges and facilitating progress.
- **Project Sponsor**: individual or entity responsible for commitiing organizational resources, providing funding, and certifying project objectives.
Often selects the project leader and other key roles helping to form the beginning phases of the project team that will actually achieve the initiatives and objectives that the sponsor has defined. 
- **Product Owner**: Additional role often fullfilled by project sponsor prioritizes requirments for ongoing work based on an understanding of value, risk, and activity dependencies. 
- **Domain SME**: typically associated with the peoject for only a portion of its total duration.
- **Customer**: May also serve as the product owner depondeing on the nature of project. Represents the primary beneficiary of project work, defines vale and verfies deliverables are acceptable. Provides useful insight in specifying requirments and may assist in implementation activities.
- **End User**: May or may not be the same as customer. Will be most directly impacted by the project's implementation and is an important source of perspective in planning and validating work.
- **Governance**: May be internal to the team or organization or may be an external regulatory authority. Ensures project work and results are in compliance and may provide approval in case of formal review
# 05.02.2023 Project Management: Lession 1: Project Foundations
- Needs Assessment: May be conduct by Project Manager or Business Analtyst. To determine what the underlaying needs might be that indicate that there is on opportunity for a project to create value or to solve problems. By addressing needs, value is created. 
- Business Case
	- Business case lists objectives and justifications for project initiation
	- Should indicate economic feasibility and expected net benefit of project
	- Timeline of benefits realization vs. cost incurrence should be described

# 22.12.2022 Agile Project Management: Basics Of A User Story
- What
  - It describes a feature (or component of a feature) and is short and simple.
- Who
  - It’s from the perspective of the person who will use the feature.
- Why
  - It incorporates the “value” of the feature so the team knows what is driving this request.
- When
  - User stories are prioritized in terms of when they’ll be completed.
- Create User Stories: 
  - You and your team will create and capture user stories in a specific format.
    - “As a… I want… so that…”.
    - As a…
      - This describes who the user is. You might design a feature differently if you know that the end user is tech-savvy versus one who is not.
    - I want…
      - This expresses what the user is trying to accomplish. Understanding the feature request is critical to delivering the right thing.
    - So that…
      - This is perhaps the most critical part of the user story format. Why the user wants to accomplish something can be very enlightening to the goal just described.
      - As [USER], I want [Some Feature] so that I can [Get some Value].
      - As a restaurant owner, I want to be able to put my menu online so that people will be interested in my restaurant.  --- > What vs How.
- Create a Task:
  - Has the Scrum Master or Disciplined Agile Scrum Master worked with the team to determine the tasks that will be completed during the sprint?
  - Are the user story point estimates in the sprint agreed to by the team members?
  - Does everyone understand the work they need to complete during this upcoming sprint?
  - Does the workload realistically match the team’s capacity?
# 21.12.2022 Agile Mindset: Treating Software Different From Manufacturing
- Management of software is simply impossible without a very high degree of documentation. Why so much documentation:
  - 1) Enough designer must communicate with interfacing designers, which his management and possibly with the customer. A verbal record is too intangible to provide an adequate basis for an interface or management decision. An acceptable written description forces the designer to take an uniquivocal position and provide tangible evedence of completion.
  - 2) During the aerly phase of software development the documentation is the specification and is the design

               - Mange team members
          - Department 
          - Team Member(s)
- Have we listed all the project assumptions we can think of?

# 14.12.2022 Organization Structure: How Organization Structure Affects Projects
- Hierarchy: each person reports to only one supervisor
     - PM has almost no authority
     - Functional Manager is typically in charge of things like project budget
     - Resources are hard to come by because they report to Functional Managers not PMs.
     - PM has divided responsibilities 
- Matrix: where people report to both managers and PMs
     - PM has some authority to make decision
     - Resources repoert to Two managers, Functional Manager & Project Manager
     - PM and staff work full time in a strong matrix
- Projectized: Where most of the people work on projects
     - PM has almost complete authority
     - Resources are dedicated to project
     - PM and admin staff work full time  

# 14.12.2022 Project Managmenet Approaches: Waterfall vs Agile Project Management

     - Experience resources 
- Agile Approach: 
     - To deliver partial, yet production-quality solutions at regular intervals
     - Value deliver sooner
     - More customer involment
     - Small independent teams
# 14.12.2022 Process Groups: PM can be categorized into 5 Groups of Process
- Initiating: is about getting the commitment to start a project.
    - Defining the project: 
    - What’s the project supposed to accomplish?
    - What’s the scope?
    - What’s the rough estimate of Resources needed and the cost?
    - Identifying the Stakeholders and make sure they agree on what the project is.
    - Ask for Approval to proceed. 
- Planning: is where you figure out how you’re going to perform the project.
    - What are we going to do?
    - How are we going to do it?
    - How will we know when it’s done?
    - Executing: Lunching a project, bring the resources on board, get them settled in, and explain the rules you’re using to run the project.
- Executing: Lunching a project, bring the resources on board, get them settled in, and explain the rules you’re using to run the project.
- Monitoring and Controlling
    - Checking what’s going on the project?
    - How that compares to what you planned?
- Closing Process: this part is short but important
     - Get the cleint to accept project is complete
     - Document the project performance, gather lesson learnes, 
     - Close contracts
     - Help resources move to the their next assigments.

# 07.12.2022 Risk Management: Risk Matrix
- Identify risk and then make them less of a proble, and then report to our boss, customer, or stakeholders what the risks are that we have not been able to get rid of. 
- **Risk Factor** = How likely they are to happen?
- **Impact Factor** = How serious they would be if they did happen?
- The Unknown
  - Remember that a risk is something that hasn’t happened yet. Risks that you are aware of are called issues.
- The Flip Side
  - Risk is not always negative. It can be positive, as well. Act on opportunities that can make the project go faster or provide greater value.
- Categorizing Risks
  - Risks can be analyzed and prioritized using the following categories:
    - Avoidance: Remove risky areas from the project scope
    - Mitigation: Do some risk response planning to reduce the likelihood of occurrence, impact, or both
    - Transferral: Move risky work to someone else (e.g., a subcontractor via modification to their statement of work)
    - Acceptance: Accept and deal with the risk (this would happen if the cost to mitigate exceeds the cost of the risk itself)
- QUESTIONS TO ASK THE TEAM
  - Can anyone spot any risks or opportunities coming down the pike?
- QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR SPONSOR
  - Can your Sponsor think of any risks that might occur based on historical information or previous similar projects?
- Risk Response Planning is the process of developing options and determining actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to the project's objectives.

# 04.12.2022 Terminologies: Key Terms and Concepts
- Outcome =
- Portfolio = Projects, programs, subsidiary portfilios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives
- Portfolio Mangemnet= The centralized management of one or more portfolios to achieve strategic objectives
- Product =
- Program = Related projects, subsidiary programms, and program activities that are managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually
- Project = A temporary endeavor undertaken to create aunique product, service, or result
- Project Management = 
- Program Mangement = The application of knowledge, skills, and principles to a program to achieve the program objectives and obtain benefits and control not available by managing program components individually
- Project Manager = 
- Project Team =
- System for Value Delivery = 
- Value =
- features describe the main functionality of the product. 
- Epics are a way to break features into smaller chunks of work.
- Project Life Cycle = can be predictive or adaptive. Whithin a project life cycle, there are generally one or more phases that are associated with the development of product, service, or result. These are called development life cycle, which can be predictive, adaptive, iterative, incremental, or hybrid model.
- Project Phase = is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of one or more deliverables.

- 25/10 crowd sourcing approach
- Penny Game Agile
	- most of us cling to the notion that we could just focus on our work in a quiet office all by ourselves, we'd be much more productive. The problem is that you’re actually right but most organizations aren’t just one individual. 
	- You as an individual probably would be much more productive just working on your own tasks but as a team overall, you’d actually be less productive. You probably don’t believe me and that’s why I love penny game.
	- You’ll arrange several people around a table. These people represent members of a team or even different functional areas. Each team member has their own batch of work. To keep things simple, this work is just to fill pennies.  
	- Each team member flips pennies two at a time then pass them to a coworker. To monitor the team’s progress, you can record how long it takes each person to finish their work and how long it takes for the customer to get their first glance of the product and when it’s finished.
	- I usually run the penny game in the three rounds. For the first round, I have each person flip all 10 pennies. Remember that this is how most people prefer to work. They can just focus on all 10 pennies and when they’re done, they can hand it off to the next person. This is the equivalent of sitting in your office all day and focusing just on your own work. You can see that each person is pretty productive. Their finishing their big batches around 10 second but the customer doesn’t get their product until 52 seconds. Foe the second round, the team creates two batches of five pennies. In this smaller batch, their coworkers can start working much more quickly. Each team member doesn’t have to wait for the full handoff. They can start to work as soon as they receive their first batch. So you can see this is making each individual team member much less productive.
	- The smaller batches are slowing down each person. So now everyone is hovering around 12 seconds but the customer gets their first batch of work in only 28 seconds and then the team finished in 34 seconds. 
	- For the third round, they break their work down into five batches of two pennies so we’re getting rid of these big handoffs and keeping the team from multitasking. Everyone is focused on their own two pennies. It took each team member around 14 seconds to complete the work, four seconds longer than the batch of 10 but the customer gets to see the work dramatically faster, receiving the first glimpse in only 11 seconds and the entire product in 23 seconds, half the time of the first round. 
	- During the first round when people could focus on the entire batch, they were individually more productive but the customer
